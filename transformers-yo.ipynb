I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure\\n\\nmy dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success\\n\\nof my undertaking.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of\\n\\nPetersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which\\n\\nbraces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this\\n\\nfeeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards\\n\\nwhich I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.\\n\\nInspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent\\n\\nand vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of\\n\\nfrost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the\\n\\nregion of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever\\n\\nvisible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a\\n\\nperpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put\\n\\nsome trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished;\\n\\nand, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in\\n\\nwonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable\\n\\nglobe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the\\n\\nphenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered\\n\\nsolitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I\\n\\nmay there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may\\n\\nregulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this\\n\\nvoyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I\\n\\nshall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world\\n\\nnever before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by\\n\\nthe foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to\\n\\nconquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this\\n\\nlaborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little\\n\\nboat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his\\n\\nnative river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you\\n\\ncannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all\\n\\nmankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole\\n\\nto those countries, to reach which at present so many months are\\n\\nrequisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at\\n\\nall possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.\\n\\n\\n\\nThese reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my\\n\\nletter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me\\n\\nto heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as\\n\\na steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual\\n\\neye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I\\n\\nhave read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have\\n\\nbeen made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean\\n\\nthrough the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a\\n\\nhistory of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the\\n\\nwhole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library. My education was neglected,\\n\\nyet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study\\n\\nday and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which\\n\\nI had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction\\n\\nhad forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.\\n\\n\\n\\nThese visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets\\n\\nwhose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also\\n\\nbecame a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;\\n\\nI imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the\\n\\nnames of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well\\n\\nacquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.\\n\\nBut just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my\\n\\nthoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.\\n\\n\\n\\nSix years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I\\n\\ncan, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this\\n\\ngreat enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I\\n\\naccompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;\\n\\nI voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often\\n\\nworked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my\\n\\nnights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those\\n\\nbranches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive\\n\\nthe greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an\\n\\nunder-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I\\n\\nmust own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second\\n\\ndignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest\\n\\nearnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?\\n\\nMy life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to\\n\\nevery enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging\\n\\nvoice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is\\n\\nfirm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am\\n\\nabout to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which\\n\\nwill demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits\\n\\nof others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly\\n\\nquickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in\\n\\nmy opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The\\n\\ncold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I have\\n\\nalready adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the\\n\\ndeck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise\\n\\nprevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no\\n\\nambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and\\n\\nArchangel.\\n\\n\\n\\nI shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my\\n\\nintention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the\\n\\ninsurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary\\n\\namong those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to\\n\\nsail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how\\n\\ncan I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,\\n\\nwill pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon,\\n\\nor never.\\n\\n\\n\\nFarewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you,\\n\\nand save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your\\n\\nlove and kindness.\\n\\n\\n\\nYour affectionate brother,\\n\\n\\n\\nR. Walton\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLetter 2\\n\\n\\n\\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\\n\\n\\n\\nArchangel, 28th March, 17—.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!\\n\\nYet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a\\n\\nvessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have\\n\\nalready engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly\\n\\npossessed of dauntless courage.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the\\n\\nabsence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no\\n\\nfriend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there\\n\\nwill be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no\\n\\none will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts\\n\\nto paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of\\n\\nfeeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose\\n\\neyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I\\n\\nbitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet\\n\\ncourageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose\\n\\ntastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a\\n\\nfriend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution\\n\\nand too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me\\n\\nthat I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild\\n\\non a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages.\\n\\nAt that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own\\n\\ncountry; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its\\n\\nmost important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the\\n\\nnecessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native\\n\\ncountry. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many\\n\\nschoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my\\n\\ndaydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters\\n\\ncall it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense\\n\\nenough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to\\n\\nendeavour to regulate my mind.\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the\\n\\nwide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet\\n\\nsome feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these\\n\\nrugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage\\n\\nand enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase\\n\\nmore characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an\\n\\nEnglishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,\\n\\nunsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of\\n\\nhumanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;\\n\\nfinding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist\\n\\nin my enterprise.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the\\n\\nship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This\\n\\ncircumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made\\n\\nme very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years\\n\\nspent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the\\n\\ngroundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to\\n\\nthe usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be\\n\\nnecessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness\\n\\nof heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt\\n\\nmyself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard\\n\\nof him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the\\n\\nhappiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved\\n\\na young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable\\n\\nsum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw\\n\\nhis mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in\\n\\ntears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,\\n\\nconfessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,\\n\\nand that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend\\n\\nreassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,\\n\\ninstantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his\\n\\nmoney, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he\\n\\nbestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his\\n\\nprize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young\\n\\nwoman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old\\n\\nman decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,\\n\\nwhen he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned\\n\\nuntil he heard that his former mistress was married according to her\\n\\ninclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is\\n\\nso; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind\\n\\nof ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct\\n\\nthe more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which\\n\\notherwise he would command.\\n\\n\\n\\nYet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can\\n\\nconceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am\\n\\nwavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage\\n\\nis only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The\\n\\nwinter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it\\n\\nis considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail\\n\\nsooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me\\n\\nsufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the\\n\\nsafety of others is committed to my care.\\n\\n\\n\\nI cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my\\n\\nundertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of\\n\\nthe trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which\\n\\nI am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to “the\\n\\nland of mist and snow,” but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not\\n\\nbe alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and\\n\\nwoeful as the “Ancient Mariner.” You will smile at my allusion, but I\\n\\nwill disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my\\n\\npassionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that\\n\\nproduction of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something\\n\\nat work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practically\\n\\nindustrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and\\n\\nlabour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief\\n\\nin the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out\\n\\nof the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited\\n\\nregions I am about to explore.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after\\n\\nhaving traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of\\n\\nAfrica or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to\\n\\nlook on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to\\n\\nme by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when\\n\\nI need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. \\n\\nRemember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.\\n\\n\\n\\nYour affectionate brother,\\n\\n Robert Walton\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLetter 3\\n\\n\\n\\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\\n\\n\\n\\nJuly 7th, 17—.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy dear Sister,\\n\\n\\n\\nI write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe—and well advanced\\n\\non my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on\\n\\nits homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not\\n\\nsee my native land, perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good\\n\\nspirits: my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the\\n\\nfloating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers\\n\\nof the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We\\n\\nhave already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of\\n\\nsummer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales,\\n\\nwhich blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire\\n\\nto attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not\\n\\nexpected.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a\\n\\nletter. One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are\\n\\naccidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and\\n\\nI shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured that for my own sake, as well as\\n\\nyours, I will not rashly encounter danger. I will be cool,\\n\\npersevering, and prudent.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut success _shall_ crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far I\\n\\nhave gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars\\n\\nthemselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. Why not\\n\\nstill proceed over the untamed yet obedient element? What can stop the\\n\\ndetermined heart and resolved will of man?\\n\\n\\n\\nMy swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I must\\n\\nfinish. Heaven bless my beloved sister!\\n\\n\\n\\nR.W.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLetter 4\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\\n\\n\\n\\nAugust 5th, 17—.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear\\n\\nrecording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before\\n\\nthese papers can come into your possession.\\n\\n\\n\\nLast Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed\\n\\nin the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which\\n\\nshe floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we\\n\\nwere compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to,\\n\\nhoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out\\n\\nin every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to\\n\\nhave no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to\\n\\ngrow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly\\n\\nattracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own\\n\\nsituation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by\\n\\ndogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a\\n\\nbeing which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,\\n\\nsat in the sledge and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress\\n\\nof the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the\\n\\ndistant inequalities of the ice.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed,\\n\\nmany hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that\\n\\nit was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by\\n\\nice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the\\n\\ngreatest attention.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before\\n\\nnight the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the\\n\\nmorning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which\\n\\nfloat about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to\\n\\nrest for a few hours.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and\\n\\nfound all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently\\n\\ntalking to someone in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we\\n\\nhad seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large\\n\\nfragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human\\n\\nbeing within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.\\n\\nHe was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of\\n\\nsome undiscovered island, but a European. When I appeared on deck the\\n\\nmaster said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish\\n\\non the open sea.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOn perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a\\n\\nforeign accent. “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he,\\n\\n“will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?”\\n\\n\\n\\nYou may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed\\n\\nto me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have\\n\\nsupposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not\\n\\nhave exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I\\n\\nreplied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the\\n\\nnorthern pole.\\n\\n\\n\\nUpon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.\\n\\nGood God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for\\n\\nhis safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were\\n\\nnearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and\\n\\nsuffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted\\n\\nto carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh\\n\\nair he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the deck and\\n\\nrestored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to\\n\\nswallow a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life we\\n\\nwrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the\\n\\nkitchen stove. By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,\\n\\nwhich restored him wonderfully.\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often\\n\\nfeared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he\\n\\nhad in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and\\n\\nattended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more\\n\\ninteresting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of\\n\\nwildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone\\n\\nperforms an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most\\n\\ntrifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with\\n\\na beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he\\n\\nis generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his\\n\\nteeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off\\n\\nthe men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not\\n\\nallow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body\\n\\nand mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.\\n\\nOnce, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice\\n\\nin so strange a vehicle.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and\\n\\nhe replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we\\n\\nsaw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThis aroused the stranger’s attention, and he asked a multitude of\\n\\nquestions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had\\n\\npursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, “I have,\\n\\ndoubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good\\n\\npeople; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to\\n\\ntrouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have\\n\\nbenevolently restored me to life.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSoon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the\\n\\nice had destroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not answer\\n\\nwith any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near\\n\\nmidnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety\\n\\nbefore that time; but of this I could not judge.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the\\n\\nstranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for\\n\\nthe sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in\\n\\nthe cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.\\n\\nI have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant\\n\\nnotice if any new object should appear in sight.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuch is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the\\n\\npresent day. The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very\\n\\nsilent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.\\n\\nYet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all\\n\\ninterested in him, although they have had very little communication\\n\\nwith him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his\\n\\nconstant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must\\n\\nhave been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck\\n\\nso attractive and amiable.\\n\\n\\n\\nI said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend\\n\\non the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been\\n\\nbroken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother\\n\\nof my heart.\\n\\n\\n\\nI shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals,\\n\\nshould I have any fresh incidents to record.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAugust 13th, 17—.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my\\n\\nadmiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so\\n\\nnoble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant\\n\\ngrief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and\\n\\nwhen he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art,\\n\\nyet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck,\\n\\napparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although\\n\\nunhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he\\n\\ninterests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently\\n\\nconversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without\\n\\ndisguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my\\n\\neventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken\\n\\nto secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the\\n\\nlanguage of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul\\n\\nand to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would\\n\\nsacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my\\n\\nenterprise. One man’s life or death were but a small price to pay for\\n\\nthe acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should\\n\\nacquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a\\n\\ndark gloom spread over my listener’s countenance. At first I\\n\\nperceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before\\n\\nhis eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle\\n\\nfast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I\\n\\npaused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: “Unhappy man! Do you\\n\\nshare my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me;\\n\\nlet me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!”\\n\\n\\n\\nSuch words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the\\n\\nparoxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened\\n\\npowers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were\\n\\nnecessary to restore his composure.\\n\\n\\n\\nHaving conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise\\n\\nhimself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of\\n\\ndespair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked\\n\\nme the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it\\n\\nawakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a\\n\\nfriend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than\\n\\nhad ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could\\n\\nboast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I agree with you,” replied the stranger; “we are\\n\\nunfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than\\n\\nourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to\\n\\nperfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most\\n\\nnoble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting\\n\\nfriendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for\\n\\ndespair. But I—I have lost everything and cannot begin life\\n\\nanew.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled\\n\\ngrief that touched me to the heart. But he was silent and presently\\n\\nretired to his cabin.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he\\n\\ndoes the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight\\n\\nafforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of\\n\\nelevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he\\n\\nmay suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he\\n\\nhas retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a\\n\\nhalo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.\\n\\n\\n\\nWill you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine\\n\\nwanderer? You would not if you saw him. You have been tutored and\\n\\nrefined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore\\n\\nsomewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to\\n\\nappreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. Sometimes I\\n\\nhave endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that\\n\\nelevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew. I\\n\\nbelieve it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing\\n\\npower of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled\\n\\nfor clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a\\n\\nvoice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAugust 19th, 17—.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYesterday the stranger said to me, “You may easily perceive, Captain\\n\\nWalton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had\\n\\ndetermined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with\\n\\nme, but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for\\n\\nknowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the\\n\\ngratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine\\n\\nhas been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be\\n\\nuseful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same\\n\\ncourse, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me\\n\\nwhat I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one\\n\\nthat may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you\\n\\nin case of failure. Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually\\n\\ndeemed marvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might\\n\\nfear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things\\n\\nwill appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would\\n\\nprovoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers\\n\\nof nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series\\n\\ninternal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.”\\n\\n\\n\\nYou may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered\\n\\ncommunication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by\\n\\na recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear\\n\\nthe promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong\\n\\ndesire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power. I expressed\\n\\nthese feelings in my answer.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it is\\n\\nuseless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I\\n\\nshall repose in peace. I understand your feeling,” continued he,\\n\\nperceiving that I wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, my\\n\\nfriend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my\\n\\ndestiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is\\n\\ndetermined.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I\\n\\nshould be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have\\n\\nresolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to\\n\\nrecord, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during\\n\\nthe day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This\\n\\nmanuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who\\n\\nknow him, and who hear it from his own lips—with what interest and\\n\\nsympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I commence my\\n\\ntask, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me\\n\\nwith all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in\\n\\nanimation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul\\n\\nwithin. Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which\\n\\nembraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it—thus!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most\\n\\ndistinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years\\n\\ncounsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public\\n\\nsituations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who\\n\\nknew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public\\n\\nbusiness. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the\\n\\naffairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his\\n\\nmarrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a\\n\\nhusband and the father of a family.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot\\n\\nrefrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a\\n\\nmerchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous\\n\\nmischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a\\n\\nproud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty\\n\\nand oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been\\n\\ndistinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts,\\n\\ntherefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his\\n\\ndaughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in\\n\\nwretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and\\n\\nwas deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.\\n\\nHe bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct\\n\\nso little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in\\n\\nendeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin\\n\\nthe world again through his credit and assistance.\\n\\n\\n\\nBeaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten\\n\\nmonths before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery,\\n\\nhe hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the\\n\\nReuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort\\n\\nhad saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but\\n\\nit was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in\\n\\nthe meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a\\n\\nmerchant’s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;\\n\\nhis grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for\\n\\nreflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end\\n\\nof three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw\\n\\nwith despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that\\n\\nthere was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort\\n\\npossessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support\\n\\nher in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw and\\n\\nby various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to\\n\\nsupport life.\\n\\n\\n\\nSeveral months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time\\n\\nwas more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence\\n\\ndecreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving\\n\\nher an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt\\n\\nby Beaufort’s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the\\n\\nchamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who\\n\\ncommitted herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he\\n\\nconducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a\\n\\nrelation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but\\n\\nthis circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted\\n\\naffection. There was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind\\n\\nwhich rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love\\n\\nstrongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the\\n\\nlate-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set\\n\\na greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and\\n\\nworship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the\\n\\ndoting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her\\n\\nvirtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing\\n\\nher for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace\\n\\nto his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes\\n\\nand her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is\\n\\nsheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her\\n\\nwith all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and\\n\\nbenevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto\\n\\nconstant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During\\n\\nthe two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had\\n\\ngradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after\\n\\ntheir union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change\\n\\nof scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,\\n\\nas a restorative for her weakened frame.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born\\n\\nat Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained\\n\\nfor several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each\\n\\nother, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very\\n\\nmine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother’s tender caresses and\\n\\nmy father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my\\n\\nfirst recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something\\n\\nbetter—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on\\n\\nthem by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in\\n\\ntheir hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled\\n\\ntheir duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed\\n\\ntowards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit\\n\\nof tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during\\n\\nevery hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity,\\n\\nand of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but\\n\\none train of enjoyment to me.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a\\n\\ndaughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five\\n\\nyears old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they\\n\\npassed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent\\n\\ndisposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my\\n\\nmother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a\\n\\npassion—remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been\\n\\nrelieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the\\n\\nafflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale\\n\\nattracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number\\n\\nof half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst\\n\\nshape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother,\\n\\naccompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife,\\n\\nhard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to\\n\\nfive hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother far\\n\\nabove all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were\\n\\ndark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her\\n\\nhair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her\\n\\nclothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was\\n\\nclear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of\\n\\nher face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold\\n\\nher without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent,\\n\\nand bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and\\n\\nadmiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was\\n\\nnot her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a\\n\\nGerman and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with\\n\\nthese good people to nurse: they were better off then. They had not been\\n\\nlong married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of their\\n\\ncharge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory\\n\\nof Italy—one among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exerted\\n\\nhimself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its\\n\\nweakness. Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria\\n\\nwas not known. His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and\\n\\na beggar. She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude\\n\\nabode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of\\n\\nour villa a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed\\n\\nto shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter\\n\\nthan the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his\\n\\npermission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their\\n\\ncharge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed\\n\\na blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty\\n\\nand want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They\\n\\nconsulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza\\n\\nbecame the inmate of my parents’ house—my more than\\n\\nsister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and\\n\\nmy pleasures.\\n\\n\\n\\nEveryone loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential\\n\\nattachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my\\n\\npride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being brought to\\n\\nmy home, my mother had said playfully, “I have a pretty present for my\\n\\nVictor—tomorrow he shall have it.” And when, on the morrow, she\\n\\npresented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish\\n\\nseriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth\\n\\nas mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on\\n\\nher I received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other\\n\\nfamiliarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could body\\n\\nforth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than\\n\\nsister, since till death she was to be mine only.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in\\n\\nour ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of\\n\\ndisunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and\\n\\nthe diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us\\n\\nnearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated\\n\\ndisposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense\\n\\napplication and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.\\n\\nShe busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets;\\n\\nand in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss\\n\\nhome —the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons,\\n\\ntempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of\\n\\nour Alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight.\\n\\nWhile my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the\\n\\nmagnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their\\n\\ncauses. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.\\n\\nCuriosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,\\n\\ngladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the\\n\\nearliest sensations I can remember.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave\\n\\nup entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native\\n\\ncountry. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive,\\n\\nthe eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a\\n\\nleague from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the\\n\\nlives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my\\n\\ntemper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was\\n\\nindifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united\\n\\nmyself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry\\n\\nClerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular\\n\\ntalent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for\\n\\nits own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He\\n\\ncomposed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and\\n\\nknightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into\\n\\nmasquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of\\n\\nRoncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous\\n\\ntrain who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands\\n\\nof the infidels.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My\\n\\nparents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.\\n\\nWe felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to\\n\\ntheir caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights\\n\\nwhich we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families I distinctly\\n\\ndiscerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted\\n\\nthe development of filial love.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some\\n\\nlaw in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits\\n\\nbut to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things\\n\\nindiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages,\\n\\nnor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states\\n\\npossessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth\\n\\nthat I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of\\n\\nthings or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man\\n\\nthat occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical,\\n\\nor in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.\\n\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral\\n\\nrelations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes,\\n\\nand the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was\\n\\nto become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the\\n\\ngallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soul\\n\\nof Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.\\n\\nHer sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of\\n\\nher celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was\\n\\nthe living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become\\n\\nsullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that\\n\\nshe was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And\\n\\nClerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval? Yet\\n\\nhe might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his\\n\\ngenerosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for\\n\\nadventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of\\n\\nbeneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring\\n\\nambition.\\n\\n\\n\\nI feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood,\\n\\nbefore misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of\\n\\nextensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides,\\n\\nin drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which\\n\\nled, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would\\n\\naccount to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my\\n\\ndestiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost\\n\\nforgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent\\n\\nwhich, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.\\n\\n\\n\\nNatural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,\\n\\ntherefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my\\n\\npredilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age we all went\\n\\non a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the\\n\\nweather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I\\n\\nchanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it\\n\\nwith apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful\\n\\nfacts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new\\n\\nlight seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my\\n\\ndiscovery to my father. My father looked carelessly at the title page of my\\n\\nbook and said, “Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste\\n\\nyour time upon this; it is sad trash.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIf, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me\\n\\nthat the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern\\n\\nsystem of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers\\n\\nthan the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while\\n\\nthose of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I\\n\\nshould certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my\\n\\nimagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my\\n\\nformer studies. It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never\\n\\nhave received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. But the cursory glance\\n\\nmy father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was\\n\\nacquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest\\n\\navidity.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this\\n\\nauthor, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and\\n\\nstudied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me\\n\\ntreasures known to few besides myself. I have described myself as always\\n\\nhaving been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of\\n\\nnature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern\\n\\nphilosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.\\n\\nSir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking\\n\\nup shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his\\n\\nsuccessors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted\\n\\nappeared even to my boy’s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same\\n\\npursuit.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted\\n\\nwith their practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little\\n\\nmore. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal\\n\\nlineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect,\\n\\nanatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes\\n\\nin their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. I\\n\\nhad gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep\\n\\nhuman beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and\\n\\nignorantly I had repined.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew\\n\\nmore. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their\\n\\ndisciple. It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth\\n\\ncentury; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of\\n\\nGeneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite\\n\\nstudies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a\\n\\nchild’s blindness, added to a student’s thirst for knowledge.\\n\\nUnder the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest\\n\\ndiligence into the search of the philosopher’s stone and the elixir\\n\\nof life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. Wealth was an\\n\\ninferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could\\n\\nbanish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but\\n\\na violent death!\\n\\n\\n\\nNor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a\\n\\npromise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which\\n\\nI most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I\\n\\nattributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a\\n\\nwant of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I was\\n\\noccupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand\\n\\ncontradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of\\n\\nmultifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish\\n\\nreasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near\\n\\nBelrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. It\\n\\nadvanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once\\n\\nwith frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained,\\n\\nwhile the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.\\n\\nAs I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an\\n\\nold and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so\\n\\nsoon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing\\n\\nremained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning, we found\\n\\nthe tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the\\n\\nshock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. I never beheld\\n\\nanything so utterly destroyed.\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of\\n\\nelectricity. On this occasion a man of great research in natural\\n\\nphilosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on\\n\\nthe explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of\\n\\nelectricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.\\n\\nAll that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa,\\n\\nAlbertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by\\n\\nsome fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my\\n\\naccustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever\\n\\nbe known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew\\n\\ndespicable. By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps\\n\\nmost subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former\\n\\noccupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed\\n\\nand abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a\\n\\nwould-be science which could never even step within the threshold of\\n\\nreal knowledge. In this mood of mind I betook myself to the\\n\\nmathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as\\n\\nbeing built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.\\n\\n\\n\\nThus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments\\n\\nare we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me\\n\\nas if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the\\n\\nimmediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life—the last effort\\n\\nmade by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even\\n\\nthen hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me. Her victory was\\n\\nannounced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which\\n\\nfollowed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting\\n\\nstudies. It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with\\n\\ntheir prosecution, happiness with their disregard.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual.\\n\\nDestiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and\\n\\nterrible destruction.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I\\n\\nshould become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had\\n\\nhitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it\\n\\nnecessary for the completion of my education that I should be made\\n\\nacquainted with other customs than those of my native country. My\\n\\ndeparture was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day\\n\\nresolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life\\n\\noccurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery.\\n\\n\\n\\nElizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was\\n\\nin the greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urged to\\n\\npersuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at first\\n\\nyielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her\\n\\nfavourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She\\n\\nattended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity\\n\\nof the distemper—Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this\\n\\nimprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother\\n\\nsickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the\\n\\nlooks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her\\n\\ndeathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert\\n\\nher. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. “My\\n\\nchildren,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness were\\n\\nplaced on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the\\n\\nconsolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to\\n\\nmy younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy\\n\\nand beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But these are\\n\\nnot thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to\\n\\ndeath and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.\\n\\nI need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent\\n\\nby that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the\\n\\nsoul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so\\n\\nlong before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day\\n\\nand whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed\\n\\nfor ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been\\n\\nextinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear\\n\\ncan be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of\\n\\nthe first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the\\n\\nevil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has\\n\\nnot that rude hand rent away some dear connection? And why should I\\n\\ndescribe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at\\n\\nlength arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and\\n\\nthe smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a\\n\\nsacrilege, is not banished. My mother was dead, but we had still\\n\\nduties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the\\n\\nrest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the\\n\\nspoiler has not seized.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events,\\n\\nwas now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of\\n\\nsome weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose,\\n\\nakin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of\\n\\nlife. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I was\\n\\nunwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above\\n\\nall, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.\\n\\nShe looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and\\n\\nzeal. She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call\\n\\nher uncle and cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time,\\n\\nwhen she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.\\n\\nShe forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the last\\n\\nevening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit\\n\\nhim to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain. His\\n\\nfather was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the\\n\\naspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune\\n\\nof being debarred from a liberal education. He said little, but when\\n\\nhe spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a\\n\\nrestrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details\\n\\nof commerce.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor\\n\\npersuade ourselves to say the word “Farewell!” It was said, and we\\n\\nretired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the\\n\\nother was deceived; but when at morning’s dawn I descended to the\\n\\ncarriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my father\\n\\nagain to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to\\n\\nrenew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last\\n\\nfeminine attentions on her playmate and friend.\\n\\n\\n\\nI threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in\\n\\nthe most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by\\n\\namiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual\\n\\npleasure—I was now alone. In the university whither I was going I\\n\\nmust form my own friends and be my own protector. My life had hitherto\\n\\nbeen remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible\\n\\nrepugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and\\n\\nClerval; these were “old familiar faces,” but I believed myself\\n\\ntotally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as\\n\\nI commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I\\n\\nardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home,\\n\\nthought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had\\n\\nlonged to enter the world and take my station among other human beings. \\n\\nNow my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to\\n\\nrepent.\\n\\n\\n\\nI had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my\\n\\njourney to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the\\n\\nhigh white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted and was\\n\\nconducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to\\n\\nsome of the principal professors. Chance—or rather the evil\\n\\ninfluence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me\\n\\nfrom the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father’s\\n\\ndoor—led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He\\n\\nwas an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He\\n\\nasked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches\\n\\nof science appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied carelessly, and\\n\\npartly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal\\n\\nauthors I had studied. The professor stared. “Have you,” he\\n\\nsaid, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI replied in the affirmative. “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with\\n\\nwarmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly\\n\\nand entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems\\n\\nand useless names. Good God! In what desert land have you lived,\\n\\nwhere no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you\\n\\nhave so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they\\n\\nare ancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific\\n\\nage, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear\\n\\nsir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSo saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books\\n\\ntreating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and\\n\\ndismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following\\n\\nweek he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural\\n\\nphilosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow\\n\\nprofessor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he\\n\\nomitted.\\n\\n\\n\\nI returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long\\n\\nconsidered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I\\n\\nreturned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any\\n\\nshape. M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a\\n\\nrepulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in\\n\\nfavour of his pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and connected a\\n\\nstrain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come\\n\\nto concerning them in my early years. As a child I had not been\\n\\ncontent with the results promised by the modern professors of natural\\n\\nscience. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my\\n\\nextreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the\\n\\nsteps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the\\n\\ndiscoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.\\n\\nBesides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.\\n\\nIt was very different when the masters of the science sought\\n\\nimmortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now\\n\\nthe scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit\\n\\nitself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in\\n\\nscience was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of\\n\\nboundless grandeur for realities of little worth.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuch were my reflections during the first two or three days of my\\n\\nresidence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming\\n\\nacquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new\\n\\nabode. But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information\\n\\nwhich M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I\\n\\ncould not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver\\n\\nsentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.\\n\\nWaldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.\\n\\n\\n\\nPartly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing\\n\\nroom, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very\\n\\nunlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an\\n\\naspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his\\n\\ntemples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person\\n\\nwas short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.\\n\\nHe began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and\\n\\nthe various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing\\n\\nwith fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took\\n\\na cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of\\n\\nits elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he\\n\\nconcluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I\\n\\nshall never forget:\\n\\n\\n\\n“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he,\\n\\n“promised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters\\n\\npromise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that\\n\\nthe elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem\\n\\nonly made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or\\n\\ncrucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses\\n\\nof nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into the\\n\\nheavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of\\n\\nthe air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers;\\n\\nthey can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even\\n\\nmock the invisible world with its own shadows.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSuch were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of\\n\\nthe fate—enounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt as if my soul\\n\\nwere grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were\\n\\ntouched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was\\n\\nsounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,\\n\\none purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of\\n\\nFrankenstein—more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps\\n\\nalready marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and\\n\\nunfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.\\n\\n\\n\\nI closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of\\n\\ninsurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I\\n\\nhad no power to produce it. By degrees, after the morning’s dawn,\\n\\nsleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream.\\n\\nThere only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to\\n\\ndevote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a\\n\\nnatural talent. On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit. His\\n\\nmanners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,\\n\\nfor there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in\\n\\nhis own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I\\n\\ngave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had\\n\\ngiven to his fellow professor. He heard with attention the little\\n\\nnarration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius\\n\\nAgrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had\\n\\nexhibited. He said that “These were men to whose indefatigable zeal\\n\\nmodern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their\\n\\nknowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names\\n\\nand arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a\\n\\ngreat degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The\\n\\nlabours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever\\n\\nfail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.” I\\n\\nlistened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption\\n\\nor affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my\\n\\nprejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured\\n\\nterms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his\\n\\ninstructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have\\n\\nmade me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended\\n\\nlabours. I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to\\n\\nprocure.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a\\n\\ndisciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of\\n\\nyour success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the\\n\\ngreatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that\\n\\nI have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not\\n\\nneglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry\\n\\nchemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your\\n\\nwish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty\\n\\nexperimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural\\n\\nphilosophy, including mathematics.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his\\n\\nvarious machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and\\n\\npromising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in\\n\\nthe science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of\\n\\nbooks which I had requested, and I took my leave.\\n\\n\\n\\nThus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 4\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the\\n\\nmost comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.\\n\\nI read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,\\n\\nwhich modern inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the\\n\\nlectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the\\n\\nuniversity, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense\\n\\nand real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive\\n\\nphysiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In\\n\\nM. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by\\n\\ndogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and\\n\\ngood nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand ways\\n\\nhe smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse\\n\\ninquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was at\\n\\nfirst fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and\\n\\nsoon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the\\n\\nlight of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress\\n\\nwas rapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and\\n\\nmy proficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me,\\n\\nwith a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman\\n\\nexpressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years\\n\\npassed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was\\n\\nengaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I\\n\\nhoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can conceive\\n\\nof the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as\\n\\nothers have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in\\n\\na scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.\\n\\nA mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must\\n\\ninfallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who\\n\\ncontinually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was\\n\\nsolely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two\\n\\nyears I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical\\n\\ninstruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the\\n\\nuniversity. When I had arrived at this point and had become as well\\n\\nacquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as\\n\\ndepended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my\\n\\nresidence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought\\n\\nof returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident\\n\\nhappened that protracted my stay.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was\\n\\nthe structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with\\n\\nlife. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?\\n\\nIt was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a\\n\\nmystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming\\n\\nacquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our\\n\\ninquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined\\n\\nthenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of\\n\\nnatural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been\\n\\nanimated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this\\n\\nstudy would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the\\n\\ncauses of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became\\n\\nacquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I\\n\\nmust also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.\\n\\nIn my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my\\n\\nmind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever\\n\\nremember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared\\n\\nthe apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and\\n\\na churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of\\n\\nlife, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become\\n\\nfood for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of\\n\\nthis decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and\\n\\ncharnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most\\n\\ninsupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the\\n\\nfine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of\\n\\ndeath succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm\\n\\ninherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and\\n\\nanalysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change\\n\\nfrom life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this\\n\\ndarkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and\\n\\nwondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity\\n\\nof the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so\\n\\nmany men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same\\n\\nscience, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a\\n\\nsecret.\\n\\n\\n\\nRemember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not\\n\\nmore certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is\\n\\ntrue. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the\\n\\ndiscovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights of\\n\\nincredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of\\n\\ngeneration and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing\\n\\nanimation upon lifeless matter.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery\\n\\nsoon gave place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in\\n\\npainful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the\\n\\nmost gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so\\n\\ngreat and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been\\n\\nprogressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.\\n\\nWhat had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation\\n\\nof the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it\\n\\nall opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a\\n\\nnature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them\\n\\ntowards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already\\n\\naccomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead\\n\\nand found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly\\n\\nineffectual light.\\n\\n\\n\\nI see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes\\n\\nexpress, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with\\n\\nwhich I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end\\n\\nof my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that\\n\\nsubject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,\\n\\nto your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my\\n\\nprecepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of\\n\\nknowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town\\n\\nto be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature\\n\\nwill allow.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated\\n\\na long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.\\n\\nAlthough I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to\\n\\nprepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of\\n\\nfibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable\\n\\ndifficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the\\n\\ncreation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my\\n\\nimagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to\\n\\ndoubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful\\n\\nas man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared\\n\\nadequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should\\n\\nultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my\\n\\noperations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be\\n\\nimperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes\\n\\nplace in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present\\n\\nattempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor\\n\\ncould I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any\\n\\nargument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I\\n\\nbegan the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts\\n\\nformed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first\\n\\nintention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,\\n\\nabout eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having\\n\\nformed this determination and having spent some months in successfully\\n\\ncollecting and arranging my materials, I began.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like\\n\\na hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death\\n\\nappeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and\\n\\npour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless\\n\\nme as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would\\n\\nowe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his\\n\\nchild so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these\\n\\nreflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless\\n\\nmatter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)\\n\\nrenew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.\\n\\n\\n\\nThese thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking\\n\\nwith unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my\\n\\nperson had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very\\n\\nbrink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the\\n\\nnext day or the next hour might realise. One secret which I alone\\n\\npossessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon\\n\\ngazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless\\n\\neagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive\\n\\nthe horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps\\n\\nof the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless\\n\\nclay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but\\n\\nthen a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed\\n\\nto have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was\\n\\nindeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed\\n\\nacuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had\\n\\nreturned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and\\n\\ndisturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human\\n\\nframe. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,\\n\\nand separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,\\n\\nI kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from\\n\\ntheir sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The\\n\\ndissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;\\n\\nand often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,\\n\\nwhilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I\\n\\nbrought my work near to a conclusion.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in\\n\\none pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields\\n\\nbestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant\\n\\nvintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the\\n\\nsame feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also\\n\\nto forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had\\n\\nnot seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them, and I\\n\\nwell remembered the words of my father: “I know that while you are\\n\\npleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall\\n\\nhear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any\\n\\ninterruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties\\n\\nare equally neglected.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI knew well therefore what would be my father’s feelings, but I could\\n\\nnot tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which\\n\\nhad taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it\\n\\nwere, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection\\n\\nuntil the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature,\\n\\nshould be completed.\\n\\n\\n\\nI then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect\\n\\nto vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was\\n\\njustified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from\\n\\nblame. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and\\n\\npeaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to\\n\\ndisturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge\\n\\nis an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself\\n\\nhas a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for\\n\\nthose simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that\\n\\nstudy is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human\\n\\nmind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit\\n\\nwhatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic\\n\\naffections, Greece had not been enslaved, Cæsar would have spared his\\n\\ncountry, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the\\n\\nempires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my\\n\\ntale, and your looks remind me to proceed.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my\\n\\nsilence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.\\n\\nWinter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not\\n\\nwatch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always\\n\\nyielded me supreme delight—so deeply was I engrossed in my\\n\\noccupation. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near\\n\\nto a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had\\n\\nsucceeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared\\n\\nrather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other\\n\\nunwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.\\n\\nEvery night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most\\n\\npainful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow\\n\\ncreatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at\\n\\nthe wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone\\n\\nsustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and\\n\\namusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself\\n\\nboth of these when my creation should be complete.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment\\n\\nof my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I\\n\\ncollected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a\\n\\nspark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was\\n\\nalready one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the\\n\\npanes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the\\n\\nhalf-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature\\n\\nopen; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate\\n\\nthe wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to\\n\\nform? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as\\n\\nbeautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered\\n\\nthe work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous\\n\\nblack, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these\\n\\nluxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,\\n\\nthat seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which\\n\\nthey were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings\\n\\nof human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole\\n\\npurpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had\\n\\ndeprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour\\n\\nthat far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty\\n\\nof the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my\\n\\nheart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I\\n\\nrushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my\\n\\nbed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude\\n\\nsucceeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the\\n\\nbed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.\\n\\nBut it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest\\n\\ndreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in\\n\\nthe streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her,\\n\\nbut as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with\\n\\nthe hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I\\n\\nheld the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her\\n\\nform, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.\\n\\nI started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my\\n\\nteeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and\\n\\nyellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window\\n\\nshutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had\\n\\ncreated. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they\\n\\nmay be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some\\n\\ninarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have\\n\\nspoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to\\n\\ndetain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the\\n\\ncourtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained\\n\\nduring the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest\\n\\nagitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if\\n\\nit were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I\\n\\nhad so miserably given life.\\n\\n\\n\\nOh! No mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy\\n\\nagain endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I\\n\\nhad gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those\\n\\nmuscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing\\n\\nsuch as even Dante could not have conceived.\\n\\n\\n\\nI passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and\\n\\nhardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly\\n\\nsank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with\\n\\nthis horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had\\n\\nbeen my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a\\n\\nhell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!\\n\\n\\n\\nMorning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my\\n\\nsleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple\\n\\nand clock, which indicated the sixth hour. The porter opened the gates\\n\\nof the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into\\n\\nthe streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the\\n\\nwretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my\\n\\nview. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but\\n\\nfelt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured\\n\\nfrom a black and comfortless sky.\\n\\n\\n\\nI continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by\\n\\nbodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I\\n\\ntraversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or\\n\\nwhat I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I\\n\\nhurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:\\n\\n \\n\\n Like one who, on a lonely road,\\n\\n Doth walk in fear and dread,\\n\\n And, having once turned round, walks on,\\n\\n And turns no more his head;\\n\\n Because he knows a frightful fiend\\n\\n Doth close behind him tread.\\n\\n \\n\\n [Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner.”]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContinuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various\\n\\ndiligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why;\\n\\nbut I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming\\n\\ntowards me from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer I observed\\n\\nthat it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and\\n\\non the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me,\\n\\ninstantly sprung out. “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he,\\n\\n“how glad I am to see you! How fortunate that you should be here at\\n\\nthe very moment of my alighting!”\\n\\n\\n\\nNothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back\\n\\nto my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear\\n\\nto my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror\\n\\nand misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months,\\n\\ncalm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial\\n\\nmanner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval continued talking for\\n\\nsome time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being\\n\\npermitted to come to Ingolstadt. “You may easily believe,” said\\n\\nhe, “how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all\\n\\nnecessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping;\\n\\nand, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant\\n\\nanswer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch\\n\\nschoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: ‘I have ten thousand florins\\n\\na year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.’ But his\\n\\naffection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has\\n\\npermitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of\\n\\nknowledge.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left\\n\\nmy father, brothers, and Elizabeth.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from\\n\\nyou so seldom. By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their\\n\\naccount myself. But, my dear Frankenstein,” continued he, stopping\\n\\nshort and gazing full in my face, “I did not before remark how very ill\\n\\nyou appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for\\n\\nseveral nights.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one\\n\\noccupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see;\\n\\nbut I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an\\n\\nend and that I am at length free.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to\\n\\nallude to, the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a\\n\\nquick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and\\n\\nthe thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my\\n\\napartment might still be there, alive and walking about. I dreaded to\\n\\nbehold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.\\n\\nEntreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the\\n\\nstairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was already on the\\n\\nlock of the door before I recollected myself. I then paused, and a\\n\\ncold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly open, as\\n\\nchildren are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in\\n\\nwaiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped\\n\\nfearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed\\n\\nfrom its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good\\n\\nfortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy\\n\\nhad indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;\\n\\nbut I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed\\n\\nme; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse\\n\\nbeat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same\\n\\nplace; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.\\n\\nClerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival,\\n\\nbut when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes\\n\\nfor which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless\\n\\nlaughter frightened and astonished him.\\n\\n\\n\\n“My dear Victor,” cried he, “what, for God’s sake,\\n\\nis the matter? Do not laugh in that manner. How ill you are! What is the\\n\\ncause of all this?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do not ask me,” cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I\\n\\nthought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; “_he_ can\\n\\ntell. Oh, save me! Save me!” I imagined that the monster seized me;\\n\\nI struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoor Clerval! What must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he\\n\\nanticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I\\n\\nwas not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not\\n\\nrecover my senses for a long, long time.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for\\n\\nseveral months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I\\n\\nafterwards learned that, knowing my father’s advanced age and unfitness\\n\\nfor so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make\\n\\nElizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my\\n\\ndisorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive\\n\\nnurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he\\n\\ndid not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest\\n\\naction that he could towards them.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and\\n\\nunremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.\\n\\nThe form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever\\n\\nbefore my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my\\n\\nwords surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings\\n\\nof my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I\\n\\ncontinually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder\\n\\nindeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and\\n\\ngrieved my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became\\n\\ncapable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I\\n\\nperceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young\\n\\nbuds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was\\n\\na divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my\\n\\nconvalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in\\n\\nmy bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as\\n\\ncheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how very good\\n\\nyou are to me. This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you\\n\\npromised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever\\n\\nrepay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I\\n\\nhave been the occasion, but you will forgive me.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get\\n\\nwell as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I\\n\\nmay speak to you on one subject, may I not?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI trembled. One subject! What could it be? Could he allude to an object on\\n\\nwhom I dared not even think?\\n\\n\\n\\n“Compose yourself,” said Clerval, who observed my change of\\n\\ncolour, “I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father\\n\\nand cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your\\n\\nown handwriting. They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at\\n\\nyour long silence.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Is that all, my dear Henry? How could you suppose that my first\\n\\nthought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and\\n\\nwho are so deserving of my love?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad\\n\\nto see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from\\n\\nyour cousin, I believe.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 6\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClerval then put the following letter into my hands. It was from my\\n\\nown Elizabeth:\\n\\n\\n\\n“My dearest Cousin,\\n\\n\\n\\n“You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear\\n\\nkind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. You are\\n\\nforbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor,\\n\\nis necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long time I have thought\\n\\nthat each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have\\n\\nrestrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have\\n\\nprevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so\\n\\nlong a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to\\n\\nperform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending on\\n\\nyour sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never\\n\\nguess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of\\n\\nyour poor cousin. Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed\\n\\nyou are getting better. I eagerly hope that you will confirm this\\n\\nintelligence soon in your own handwriting.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Get well—and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home and\\n\\nfriends who love you dearly. Your father’s health is vigorous, and he\\n\\nasks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a\\n\\ncare will ever cloud his benevolent countenance. How pleased you would\\n\\nbe to remark the improvement of our Ernest! He is now sixteen and full\\n\\nof activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter\\n\\ninto foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his\\n\\nelder brother returns to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of\\n\\na military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your\\n\\npowers of application. He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his\\n\\ntime is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the\\n\\nlake. I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point\\n\\nand permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken\\n\\nplace since you left us. The blue lake and snow-clad mountains—they\\n\\nnever change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are\\n\\nregulated by the same immutable laws. My trifling occupations take up\\n\\nmy time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing\\n\\nnone but happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but one\\n\\nchange has taken place in our little household. Do you remember on\\n\\nwhat occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably you do not;\\n\\nI will relate her history, therefore in a few words. Madame Moritz,\\n\\nher mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the\\n\\nthird. This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but\\n\\nthrough a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and\\n\\nafter the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed\\n\\nthis, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother\\n\\nto allow her to live at our house. The republican institutions of our\\n\\ncountry have produced simpler and happier manners than those which\\n\\nprevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less\\n\\ndistinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the\\n\\nlower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are\\n\\nmore refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same\\n\\nthing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in\\n\\nour family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our\\n\\nfortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a\\n\\nsacrifice of the dignity of a human being.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I\\n\\nrecollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one\\n\\nglance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that\\n\\nAriosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica—she looked so\\n\\nfrank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her,\\n\\nby which she was induced to give her an education superior to that\\n\\nwhich she had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid;\\n\\nJustine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not\\n\\nmean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but\\n\\nyou could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.\\n\\nAlthough her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,\\n\\nyet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She\\n\\nthought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her\\n\\nphraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.\\n\\n\\n\\n“When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own\\n\\ngrief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness\\n\\nwith the most anxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but other\\n\\ntrials were reserved for her.\\n\\n\\n\\n“One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the\\n\\nexception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The\\n\\nconscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the\\n\\ndeaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her\\n\\npartiality. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor\\n\\nconfirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few months\\n\\nafter your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her\\n\\nrepentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she quitted our house; she\\n\\nwas much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness\\n\\nand a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable\\n\\nfor vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mother’s house of a nature\\n\\nto restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her\\n\\nrepentance. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness,\\n\\nbut much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her\\n\\nbrothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz\\n\\ninto a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is\\n\\nnow at peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather,\\n\\nat the beginning of this last winter. Justine has just returned to us;\\n\\nand I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle,\\n\\nand extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her\\n\\nexpression continually remind me of my dear aunt.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling\\n\\nWilliam. I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with\\n\\nsweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. When he\\n\\nsmiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with\\n\\nhealth. He has already had one or two little _wives,_ but Louisa Biron\\n\\nis his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little\\n\\ngossip concerning the good people of Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfield\\n\\nhas already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching\\n\\nmarriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly\\n\\nsister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your\\n\\nfavourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes\\n\\nsince the departure of Clerval from Geneva. But he has already\\n\\nrecovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a\\n\\nlively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and much\\n\\nolder than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with\\n\\neverybody.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety\\n\\nreturns upon me as I conclude. Write, dearest Victor,—one line—one\\n\\nword will be a blessing to us. Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his\\n\\nkindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely\\n\\ngrateful. Adieu! my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreat\\n\\nyou, write!\\n\\n\\n\\n“Elizabeth Lavenza.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Geneva, March 18th, 17—.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Dear, dear Elizabeth!” I exclaimed, when I had read her\\n\\nletter: “I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety\\n\\nthey must feel.” I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but\\n\\nmy convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. In another\\n\\nfortnight I was able to leave my chamber.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the\\n\\nseveral professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a\\n\\nkind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had\\n\\nsustained. Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the\\n\\nbeginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even\\n\\nto the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored\\n\\nto health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony\\n\\nof my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my\\n\\napparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he\\n\\nperceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had\\n\\npreviously been my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of\\n\\nno avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture\\n\\nwhen he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I\\n\\nhad made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the\\n\\nsubject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to\\n\\nmodesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science\\n\\nitself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What\\n\\ncould I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he\\n\\nhad placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which\\n\\nwere to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I\\n\\nwrithed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.\\n\\nClerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the\\n\\nsensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his\\n\\ntotal ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. I\\n\\nthanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly\\n\\nthat he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from\\n\\nme; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence\\n\\nthat knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in\\n\\nhim that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which\\n\\nI feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.\\n\\n\\n\\nM. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of\\n\\nalmost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even\\n\\nmore pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. “D—n\\n\\nthe fellow!” cried he; “why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has\\n\\noutstript us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A\\n\\nyoungster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly\\n\\nas in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if\\n\\nhe is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.—Ay,\\n\\nay,” continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering,\\n\\n“M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.\\n\\nYoung men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was\\n\\nmyself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.”\\n\\n\\n\\nM. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned\\n\\nthe conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.\\n\\n\\n\\nClerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his\\n\\nliterary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He\\n\\ncame to the university with the design of making himself complete\\n\\nmaster of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for\\n\\nthe plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no\\n\\ninglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording\\n\\nscope for his spirit of enterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit\\n\\nlanguages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on\\n\\nthe same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I\\n\\nwished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt\\n\\ngreat relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not\\n\\nonly instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. I\\n\\ndid not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for\\n\\nI did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary\\n\\namusement. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well\\n\\nrepaid my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy\\n\\nelevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of\\n\\nany other country. When you read their writings, life appears to\\n\\nconsist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,—in the smiles and frowns\\n\\nof a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How\\n\\ndifferent from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!\\n\\n\\n\\nSummer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was\\n\\nfixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several\\n\\naccidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable,\\n\\nand my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. I felt this\\n\\ndelay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved\\n\\nfriends. My return had only been delayed so long, from an\\n\\nunwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become\\n\\nacquainted with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent\\n\\ncheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came\\n\\nits beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily\\n\\nwhich was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a\\n\\npedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a\\n\\npersonal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited. I acceded\\n\\nwith pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval\\n\\nhad always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature\\n\\nthat I had taken among the scenes of my native country.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits\\n\\nhad long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the\\n\\nsalubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and\\n\\nthe conversation of my friend. Study had before secluded me from the\\n\\nintercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but\\n\\nClerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught\\n\\nme to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.\\n\\nExcellent friend! how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to\\n\\nelevate my mind until it was on a level with your own. A selfish\\n\\npursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and\\n\\naffection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature\\n\\nwho, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.\\n\\nWhen happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most\\n\\ndelightful sensations. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with\\n\\necstasy. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring\\n\\nbloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud. I\\n\\nwas undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed\\n\\nupon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an\\n\\ninvincible burden.\\n\\n\\n\\nHenry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he\\n\\nexerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled\\n\\nhis soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly\\n\\nastonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in\\n\\nimitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful\\n\\nfancy and passion. At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew\\n\\nme out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were\\n\\ndancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits were\\n\\nhigh, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 7\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn my return, I found the following letter from my father:—\\n\\n\\n\\n“My dear Victor,\\n\\n\\n\\n“You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of\\n\\nyour return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few\\n\\nlines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But\\n\\nthat would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be\\n\\nyour surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to\\n\\nbehold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can\\n\\nI relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous to\\n\\nour joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent\\n\\nson? I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is\\n\\nimpossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words\\n\\nwhich are to convey to you the horrible tidings.\\n\\n\\n\\n“William is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed\\n\\nmy heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered!\\n\\n\\n\\n“I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the\\n\\ncircumstances of the transaction.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to\\n\\nwalk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged\\n\\nour walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of\\n\\nreturning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone\\n\\non before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until\\n\\nthey should return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen\\n\\nhis brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William\\n\\nhad run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and\\n\\nafterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him\\n\\nuntil night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have\\n\\nreturned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with\\n\\ntorches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had\\n\\nlost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night;\\n\\nElizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning I\\n\\ndiscovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and\\n\\nactive in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the\\n\\nprint of the murder’s finger was on his neck.\\n\\n\\n\\n“He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my\\n\\ncountenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to\\n\\nsee the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted,\\n\\nand entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the\\n\\nvictim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, ‘O God! I have murdered my\\n\\ndarling child!’\\n\\n\\n\\n“She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again\\n\\nlived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same\\n\\nevening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable\\n\\nminiature that she possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, and\\n\\nwas doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We\\n\\nhave no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him\\n\\nare unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps\\n\\ncontinually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death;\\n\\nher words pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an\\n\\nadditional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?\\n\\nYour dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live\\n\\nto witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin,\\n\\nbut with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of\\n\\nfestering, the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my\\n\\nfriend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not\\n\\nwith hatred for your enemies.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Your affectionate and afflicted father,\\n\\n\\n\\n“Alphonse Frankenstein.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was\\n\\nsurprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first\\n\\nexpressed on receiving news from my friends. I threw the letter on the\\n\\ntable, and covered my face with my hands.\\n\\n\\n\\n“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me\\n\\nweep with bitterness, “are you always to be unhappy? My dear friend,\\n\\nwhat has happened?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the\\n\\nroom in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of\\n\\nClerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he;\\n\\n“your disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.”\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation;\\n\\nhe could only express his heartfelt sympathy. “Poor William!” said he,\\n\\n“dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that had\\n\\nseen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his\\n\\nuntimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel the murderer’s grasp! How\\n\\nmuch more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence! Poor little\\n\\nfellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but\\n\\nhe is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.\\n\\nA sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer\\n\\nbe a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable\\n\\nsurvivors.”\\n\\n\\n\\nClerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words\\n\\nimpressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in\\n\\nsolitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a\\n\\ncabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed\\n\\nto console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I\\n\\ndrew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain\\n\\nthe multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through\\n\\nscenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years.\\n\\nHow altered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and\\n\\ndesolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances\\n\\nmight have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were\\n\\ndone more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I\\n\\ndared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble,\\n\\nalthough I was unable to define them.\\n\\n\\n\\nI remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I\\n\\ncontemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the\\n\\nsnowy mountains, “the palaces of nature,” were not changed. By\\n\\ndegrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey\\n\\ntowards Geneva.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I\\n\\napproached my native town. I discovered more distinctly the black\\n\\nsides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like a\\n\\nchild. “Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your\\n\\nwanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and\\n\\nplacid. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on\\n\\nthese preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative\\n\\nhappiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved\\n\\ncountry! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again\\n\\nbeholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely\\n\\nlake!\\n\\n\\n\\nYet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also\\n\\nclosed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still\\n\\nmore gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I\\n\\nforesaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human\\n\\nbeings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single\\n\\ncircumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not\\n\\nconceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates\\n\\nof the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at\\n\\nSecheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. The sky\\n\\nwas serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot\\n\\nwhere my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass through the\\n\\ntown, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.\\n\\nDuring this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont\\n\\nBlanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach\\n\\nrapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its\\n\\nprogress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain\\n\\ncoming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.\\n\\n\\n\\nI quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm\\n\\nincreased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash\\n\\nover my head. It was echoed from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of\\n\\nSavoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the\\n\\nlake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant\\n\\nevery thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself\\n\\nfrom the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in\\n\\nSwitzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The\\n\\nmost violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the\\n\\nlake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of\\n\\nCopêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another\\n\\ndarkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain to the\\n\\neast of the lake.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with\\n\\na hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my\\n\\nhands, and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel! this is thy\\n\\nfuneral, this thy dirge!” As I said these words, I perceived in the\\n\\ngloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood\\n\\nfixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning\\n\\nilluminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its\\n\\ngigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs\\n\\nto humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy\\n\\ndæmon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I\\n\\nshuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that\\n\\nidea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth\\n\\nchattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure\\n\\npassed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could\\n\\nhave destroyed the fair child. _He_ was the murderer! I could not\\n\\ndoubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the\\n\\nfact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for\\n\\nanother flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly\\n\\nperpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the\\n\\nsouth. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.\\n\\n\\n\\nI remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still\\n\\ncontinued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I\\n\\nrevolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget:\\n\\nthe whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of\\n\\nthe works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure. Two years had\\n\\nnow nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and\\n\\nwas this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a\\n\\ndepraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not\\n\\nmurdered my brother?\\n\\n\\n\\nNo one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the\\n\\nnight, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not\\n\\nfeel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in\\n\\nscenes of evil and despair. I considered the being whom I had cast\\n\\namong mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes\\n\\nof horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light\\n\\nof my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced\\n\\nto destroy all that was dear to me.\\n\\n\\n\\nDay dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were\\n\\nopen, and I hastened to my father’s house. My first thought was to\\n\\ndiscover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be\\n\\nmade. But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A\\n\\nbeing whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at\\n\\nmidnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I\\n\\nremembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at\\n\\nthe time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of\\n\\ndelirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that\\n\\nif any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have\\n\\nlooked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature\\n\\nof the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited\\n\\nas to persuade my relatives to commence it. And then of what use would\\n\\nbe pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the\\n\\noverhanging sides of Mont Salêve? These reflections determined me, and\\n\\nI resolved to remain silent.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house. I\\n\\ntold the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library\\n\\nto attend their usual hour of rising.\\n\\n\\n\\nSix years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I\\n\\nstood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my\\n\\ndeparture for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained\\n\\nto me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the\\n\\nmantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my father’s\\n\\ndesire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling\\n\\nby the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;\\n\\nbut there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the\\n\\nsentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my\\n\\ntears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest\\n\\nentered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:\\n\\n“Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you\\n\\nhad come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and\\n\\ndelighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can\\n\\nalleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems\\n\\nsinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor\\n\\nElizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—Poor\\n\\nWilliam! he was our darling and our pride!”\\n\\n\\n\\nTears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortal\\n\\nagony crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined the\\n\\nwretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and\\n\\na not less terrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more\\n\\nminutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.\\n\\n\\n\\n“She most of all,” said Ernest, “requires consolation; she accused\\n\\nherself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her\\n\\nvery wretched. But since the murderer has been discovered—”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt\\n\\nto pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the\\n\\nwinds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he\\n\\nwas free last night!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I do not know what you mean,” replied my brother, in accents of\\n\\nwonder, “but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. No\\n\\none would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be\\n\\nconvinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit\\n\\nthat Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family,\\n\\ncould suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is\\n\\nwrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have\\n\\nalmost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so\\n\\nconfused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear,\\n\\nleaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried today, and you will\\n\\nthen hear all.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William\\n\\nhad been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her\\n\\nbed for several days. During this interval, one of the servants,\\n\\nhappening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the\\n\\nmurder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which\\n\\nhad been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant\\n\\ninstantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to\\n\\nany of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition,\\n\\nJustine was apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the poor girl\\n\\nconfirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of\\n\\nmanner.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied\\n\\nearnestly, “You are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor,\\n\\ngood Justine, is innocent.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAt that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed\\n\\non his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,\\n\\nafter we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced\\n\\nsome other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed,\\n\\n“Good God, papa! Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of\\n\\npoor William.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father, “for indeed I had\\n\\nrather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much\\n\\ndepravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be\\n\\ntried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThis speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that\\n\\nJustine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I\\n\\nhad no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be\\n\\nbrought forward strong enough to convict her. My tale was not one to\\n\\nannounce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as\\n\\nmadness by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, except I, the\\n\\ncreator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the\\n\\nexistence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance\\n\\nwhich I had let loose upon the world?\\n\\n\\n\\nWe were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last\\n\\nbeheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of\\n\\nher childish years. There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but\\n\\nit was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.\\n\\nShe welcomed me with the greatest affection. “Your arrival, my dear\\n\\ncousin,” said she, “fills me with hope. You perhaps will find some\\n\\nmeans to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she\\n\\nbe convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do\\n\\nupon my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only\\n\\nlost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely\\n\\nlove, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I\\n\\nnever shall know joy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not;\\n\\nand then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little\\n\\nWilliam.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“She is innocent, my Elizabeth,” said I, “and that shall\\n\\nbe proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance\\n\\nof her acquittal.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt,\\n\\nand that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to\\n\\nsee every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me\\n\\nhopeless and despairing.” She wept.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Dearest niece,” said my father, “dry your tears. If she\\n\\nis, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the\\n\\nactivity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of\\n\\npartiality.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe passed a few sad hours until eleven o’clock, when the trial was to\\n\\ncommence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend\\n\\nas witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of\\n\\nthis wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture. It was to\\n\\nbe decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would\\n\\ncause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of\\n\\ninnocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every\\n\\naggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.\\n\\nJustine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised\\n\\nto render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an\\n\\nignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I\\n\\nhave confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I\\n\\nwas absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have\\n\\nbeen considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have\\n\\nexculpated her who suffered through me.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning, and\\n\\nher countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her\\n\\nfeelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in\\n\\ninnocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by\\n\\nthousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have\\n\\nexcited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the\\n\\nimagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She\\n\\nwas tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as\\n\\nher confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she\\n\\nworked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the\\n\\ncourt she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were\\n\\nseated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly\\n\\nrecovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest\\n\\nher utter guiltlessness.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the\\n\\ncharge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined\\n\\nagainst her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof\\n\\nof her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on\\n\\nwhich the murder had been committed and towards morning had been\\n\\nperceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the\\n\\nmurdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her what she\\n\\ndid there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused\\n\\nand unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight\\n\\no’clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she\\n\\nreplied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly\\n\\nif anything had been heard concerning him. When shown the body, she\\n\\nfell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. The\\n\\npicture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;\\n\\nand when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same\\n\\nwhich, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round\\n\\nhis neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.\\n\\n\\n\\nJustine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her\\n\\ncountenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly\\n\\nexpressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was\\n\\ndesired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible\\n\\nalthough variable voice.\\n\\n\\n\\n“God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent. But I\\n\\ndo not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence\\n\\non a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced\\n\\nagainst me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my\\n\\njudges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears\\n\\ndoubtful or suspicious.”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed\\n\\nthe evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the\\n\\nhouse of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league from\\n\\nGeneva. On her return, at about nine o’clock, she met a man who asked\\n\\nher if she had seen anything of the child who was lost. She was\\n\\nalarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him,\\n\\nwhen the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain\\n\\nseveral hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being\\n\\nunwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. Most\\n\\nof the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that\\n\\nshe slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.\\n\\nIt was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour\\n\\nto find my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay,\\n\\nit was without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered when\\n\\nquestioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed\\n\\na sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.\\n\\nConcerning the picture she could give no account.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and\\n\\nfatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of\\n\\nexplaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left\\n\\nto conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been\\n\\nplaced in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have no\\n\\nenemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me\\n\\nwantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity\\n\\nafforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the\\n\\njewel, to part with it again so soon?\\n\\n\\n\\n“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for\\n\\nhope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my\\n\\ncharacter, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed\\n\\nguilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my\\n\\ninnocence.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSeveral witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and\\n\\nthey spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they\\n\\nsupposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come\\n\\nforward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent\\n\\ndispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,\\n\\nwhen, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address\\n\\nthe court.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child who\\n\\nwas murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived\\n\\nwith his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It may\\n\\ntherefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but\\n\\nwhen I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her\\n\\npretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I\\n\\nknow of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived\\n\\nin the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly\\n\\ntwo years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and\\n\\nbenevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in\\n\\nher last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards\\n\\nattended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited\\n\\nthe admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my\\n\\nuncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was\\n\\nwarmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a\\n\\nmost affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that,\\n\\nnotwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely\\n\\non her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action; as to\\n\\nthe bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it,\\n\\nI should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value\\n\\nher.”\\n\\n\\n\\nA murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth’s simple and powerful\\n\\nappeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in\\n\\nfavour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with\\n\\nrenewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. She\\n\\nherself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. My own\\n\\nagitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I believed\\n\\nin her innocence; I knew it. Could the dæmon who had (I did not for a\\n\\nminute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have\\n\\nbetrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? I could not sustain the\\n\\nhorror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and\\n\\nthe countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim,\\n\\nI rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the accused did\\n\\nnot equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of\\n\\nremorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.\\n\\n\\n\\nI passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to\\n\\nthe court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal\\n\\nquestion, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my\\n\\nvisit. The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine\\n\\nwas condemned.\\n\\n\\n\\nI cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before\\n\\nexperienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon\\n\\nthem adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the\\n\\nheart-sickening despair that I then endured. The person to whom I\\n\\naddressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt.\\n\\n“That evidence,” he observed, “was hardly required in so glaring a\\n\\ncase, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to\\n\\ncondemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so\\n\\ndecisive.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThis was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Had\\n\\nmy eyes deceived me? And was I really as mad as the whole world would\\n\\nbelieve me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions? I\\n\\nhastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.\\n\\n\\n\\n“My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided as you may have expected; all\\n\\njudges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty\\n\\nshould escape. But she has confessed.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThis was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon\\n\\nJustine’s innocence. “Alas!” said she. “How shall I\\n\\never again believe in human goodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as\\n\\nmy sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?\\n\\nHer mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has\\n\\ncommitted a murder.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSoon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my\\n\\ncousin. My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own\\n\\njudgment and feelings to decide. “Yes,” said Elizabeth,\\n\\n“I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany\\n\\nme; I cannot go alone.” The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet\\n\\nI could not refuse.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some\\n\\nstraw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on\\n\\nher knees. She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with\\n\\nher, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My\\n\\ncousin wept also.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Justine!” said she. “Why did you rob me of my last consolation?\\n\\nI relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I\\n\\nwas not so miserable as I am now.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also\\n\\njoin with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?” Her\\n\\nvoice was suffocated with sobs.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth; “why do you kneel,\\n\\nif you are innocent? I am not one of your enemies, I believed you\\n\\nguiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had\\n\\nyourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be\\n\\nassured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a\\n\\nmoment, but your own confession.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I did confess, but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might\\n\\nobtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than\\n\\nall my other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was\\n\\ncondemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced,\\n\\nuntil I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I\\n\\nwas. He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if\\n\\nI continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked\\n\\non me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I do?\\n\\nIn an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly\\n\\nmiserable.”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe paused, weeping, and then continued, “I thought with horror, my\\n\\nsweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed\\n\\naunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable\\n\\nof a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.\\n\\nDear William! dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again in\\n\\nheaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I\\n\\nam to suffer ignominy and death.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Justine! Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.\\n\\nWhy did you confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear. I\\n\\nwill proclaim, I will prove your innocence. I will melt the stony\\n\\nhearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers. You shall not die!\\n\\nYou, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!\\n\\nNo! No! I never could survive so horrible a misfortune.”\\n\\n\\n\\nJustine shook her head mournfully. “I do not fear to die,” she said;\\n\\n“that pang is past. God raises my weakness and gives me courage to\\n\\nendure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember\\n\\nme and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the\\n\\nfate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to\\n\\nthe will of heaven!”\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room,\\n\\nwhere I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair!\\n\\nWho dared talk of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass\\n\\nthe awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such\\n\\ndeep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth and ground them together,\\n\\nuttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When\\n\\nshe saw who it was, she approached me and said, “Dear sir, you are very\\n\\nkind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI could not answer. “No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is more\\n\\nconvinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you\\n\\nhad confessed, he did not credit it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest\\n\\ngratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is\\n\\nthe affection of others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more than\\n\\nhalf my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my\\n\\ninnocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed\\n\\ngained the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the\\n\\nnever-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or\\n\\nconsolation. Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was\\n\\nthe misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair\\n\\nmoon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and\\n\\ndespair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within\\n\\nme which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several hours with\\n\\nJustine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear\\n\\nherself away. “I wish,” cried she, “that I were to die with you; I\\n\\ncannot live in this world of misery.”\\n\\n\\n\\nJustine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty\\n\\nrepressed her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice\\n\\nof half-suppressed emotion, “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth,\\n\\nmy beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and\\n\\npreserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever\\n\\nsuffer! Live, and be happy, and make others so.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth’s heart-rending eloquence\\n\\nfailed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the\\n\\ncriminality of the saintly sufferer. My passionate and indignant\\n\\nappeals were lost upon them. And when I received their cold answers\\n\\nand heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed\\n\\navowal died away on my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a madman,\\n\\nbut not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. She\\n\\nperished on the scaffold as a murderess!\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and\\n\\nvoiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing! And my\\n\\nfather’s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was\\n\\nthe work of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these\\n\\nare not your last tears! Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and\\n\\nthe sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!\\n\\nFrankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he\\n\\nwho would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no\\n\\nthought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear\\n\\ncountenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life\\n\\nin serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond\\n\\nhis hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction\\n\\npause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!\\n\\n\\n\\nThus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair,\\n\\nI beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and\\n\\nJustine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 9\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have\\n\\nbeen worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of\\n\\ninaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope\\n\\nand fear. Justine died, she rested, and I was alive. The blood flowed\\n\\nfreely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my\\n\\nheart which nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered\\n\\nlike an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond\\n\\ndescription horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet\\n\\nbehind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.\\n\\nI had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment\\n\\nwhen I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow\\n\\nbeings. Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience\\n\\nwhich allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and\\n\\nfrom thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and\\n\\nthe sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures\\n\\nsuch as no language can describe.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never\\n\\nentirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. I shunned\\n\\nthe face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me;\\n\\nsolitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, deathlike solitude.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition\\n\\nand habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his\\n\\nserene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and\\n\\nawaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.\\n\\n“Do you think, Victor,” said he, “that I do not suffer\\n\\nalso? No one could love a child more than I loved your\\n\\nbrother”—tears came into his eyes as he spoke—“but\\n\\nis it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting\\n\\ntheir unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty\\n\\nowed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment,\\n\\nor even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for\\n\\nsociety.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThis advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I\\n\\nshould have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if\\n\\nremorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my\\n\\nother sensations. Now I could only answer my father with a look of\\n\\ndespair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was\\n\\nparticularly agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates regularly at\\n\\nten o’clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that\\n\\nhour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome\\n\\nto me. I was now free. Often, after the rest of the family had\\n\\nretired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the\\n\\nwater. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and\\n\\nsometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to\\n\\npursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I\\n\\nwas often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only\\n\\nunquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and\\n\\nheavenly—if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and\\n\\ninterrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often,\\n\\nI say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters\\n\\nmight close over me and my calamities for ever. But I was restrained,\\n\\nwhen I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly\\n\\nloved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought also of my\\n\\nfather and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them\\n\\nexposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose\\n\\namong them?\\n\\n\\n\\nAt these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my\\n\\nmind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that\\n\\ncould not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of\\n\\nunalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had\\n\\ncreated should perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling\\n\\nthat all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime,\\n\\nwhich by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.\\n\\nThere was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained\\n\\nbehind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of\\n\\nhim I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to\\n\\nextinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I\\n\\nreflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds\\n\\nof moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the\\n\\nAndes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I wished\\n\\nto see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his\\n\\nhead and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur house was the house of mourning. My father’s health was deeply\\n\\nshaken by the horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and\\n\\ndesponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all\\n\\npleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she\\n\\nthen thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted\\n\\nand destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth\\n\\nwandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our\\n\\nfuture prospects. The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from\\n\\nthe earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest\\n\\nsmiles.\\n\\n\\n\\n“When I reflect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on the miserable death of\\n\\nJustine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before\\n\\nappeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and\\n\\ninjustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient\\n\\ndays or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to\\n\\nreason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men\\n\\nappear to me as monsters thirsting for each other’s blood. Yet I am\\n\\ncertainly unjust. Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and\\n\\nif she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly\\n\\nshe would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For the sake\\n\\nof a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend,\\n\\na child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if\\n\\nit had been her own! I could not consent to the death of any human\\n\\nbeing, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to\\n\\nremain in the society of men. But she was innocent. I know, I feel\\n\\nshe was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me.\\n\\nAlas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can\\n\\nassure themselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I were walking on\\n\\nthe edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and\\n\\nendeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were\\n\\nassassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free,\\n\\nand perhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on the\\n\\nscaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a\\n\\nwretch.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed,\\n\\nbut in effect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth read my anguish in my\\n\\ncountenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, “My dearest friend, you\\n\\nmust calm yourself. These events have affected me, God knows how\\n\\ndeeply; but I am not so wretched as you are. There is an expression of\\n\\ndespair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me\\n\\ntremble. Dear Victor, banish these dark passions. Remember the\\n\\nfriends around you, who centre all their hopes in you. Have we lost\\n\\nthe power of rendering you happy? Ah! While we love, while we are\\n\\ntrue to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native\\n\\ncountry, we may reap every tranquil blessing—what can disturb our\\n\\npeace?”\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every\\n\\nother gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my\\n\\nheart? Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at\\n\\nthat very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.\\n\\n\\n\\nThus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of\\n\\nheaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were\\n\\nineffectual. I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial\\n\\ninfluence could penetrate. The wounded deer dragging its fainting\\n\\nlimbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had\\n\\npierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.\\n\\n\\n\\nSometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but\\n\\nsometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily\\n\\nexercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable\\n\\nsensations. It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left\\n\\nmy home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought\\n\\nin the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and\\n\\nmy ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My wanderings were directed\\n\\ntowards the valley of Chamounix. I had visited it frequently during my\\n\\nboyhood. Six years had passed since then: _I_ was a wreck, but nought\\n\\nhad changed in those savage and enduring scenes.\\n\\n\\n\\nI performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I afterwards\\n\\nhired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive\\n\\ninjury on these rugged roads. The weather was fine; it was about the\\n\\nmiddle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of\\n\\nJustine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe. The\\n\\nweight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in\\n\\nthe ravine of Arve. The immense mountains and precipices that overhung\\n\\nme on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and\\n\\nthe dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as\\n\\nOmnipotence—and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less\\n\\nalmighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here\\n\\ndisplayed in their most terrific guise. Still, as I ascended higher,\\n\\nthe valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.\\n\\nRuined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the\\n\\nimpetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from\\n\\namong the trees formed a scene of singular beauty. But it was\\n\\naugmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and\\n\\nshining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another\\n\\nearth, the habitations of another race of beings.\\n\\n\\n\\nI passed the bridge of Pélissier, where the ravine, which the river\\n\\nforms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that\\n\\noverhangs it. Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix. This\\n\\nvalley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and\\n\\npicturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed. The\\n\\nhigh and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no\\n\\nmore ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers approached\\n\\nthe road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and\\n\\nmarked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and\\n\\nmagnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_,\\n\\nand its tremendous _dôme_ overlooked the valley.\\n\\n\\n\\nA tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this\\n\\njourney. Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and\\n\\nrecognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the\\n\\nlighthearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing\\n\\naccents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more. Then again the\\n\\nkindly influence ceased to act—I found myself fettered again to grief\\n\\nand indulging in all the misery of reflection. Then I spurred on my\\n\\nanimal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all,\\n\\nmyself—or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on\\n\\nthe grass, weighed down by horror and despair.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded\\n\\nto the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured.\\n\\nFor a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid\\n\\nlightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of\\n\\nthe Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath. The same lulling sounds\\n\\nacted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head\\n\\nupon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed\\n\\nthe giver of oblivion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI spent the following day roaming through the valley. I stood beside\\n\\nthe sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that\\n\\nwith slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to\\n\\nbarricade the valley. The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before\\n\\nme; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were\\n\\nscattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious\\n\\npresence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling\\n\\nwaves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the\\n\\navalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the\\n\\naccumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,\\n\\nwas ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in\\n\\ntheir hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the\\n\\ngreatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me\\n\\nfrom all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my\\n\\ngrief, they subdued and tranquillised it. In some degree, also, they\\n\\ndiverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the\\n\\nlast month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,\\n\\nwaited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I\\n\\nhad contemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the\\n\\nunstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,\\n\\nand ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds—they all\\n\\ngathered round me and bade me be at peace.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of\\n\\nsoul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every\\n\\nthought. The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the\\n\\nsummits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those\\n\\nmighty friends. Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them\\n\\nin their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule was\\n\\nbrought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of\\n\\nMontanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous\\n\\nand ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.\\n\\nIt had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the\\n\\nsoul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.\\n\\nThe sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the\\n\\neffect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing\\n\\ncares of life. I determined to go without a guide, for I was well\\n\\nacquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the\\n\\nsolitary grandeur of the scene.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short\\n\\nwindings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the\\n\\nmountain. It is a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots\\n\\nthe traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie\\n\\nbroken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,\\n\\nleaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon\\n\\nother trees. The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines\\n\\nof snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is\\n\\nparticularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking\\n\\nin a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw\\n\\ndestruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or\\n\\nluxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.\\n\\nI looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers\\n\\nwhich ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite\\n\\nmountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain\\n\\npoured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I\\n\\nreceived from the objects around me. Alas! Why does man boast of\\n\\nsensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders\\n\\nthem more necessary beings. If our impulses were confined to hunger,\\n\\nthirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by\\n\\nevery wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may\\n\\nconvey to us.\\n\\n\\n\\n  We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.\\n\\n     We rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.\\n\\n  We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,\\n\\n     Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;\\n\\n  It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,\\n\\n     The path of its departure still is free.\\n\\n  Man’s yesterday may ne’er be like his morrow;\\n\\n     Nought may endure but mutability!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some\\n\\ntime I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered\\n\\nboth that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated\\n\\nthe cloud, and I descended upon the glacier. The surface is very\\n\\nuneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and\\n\\ninterspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is almost a\\n\\nleague in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The\\n\\nopposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I\\n\\nnow stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;\\n\\nand above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess\\n\\nof the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea,\\n\\nor rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,\\n\\nwhose aerial summits hung over its recesses. Their icy and glittering\\n\\npeaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My heart, which was\\n\\nbefore sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed,\\n\\n“Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow\\n\\nbeds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion,\\n\\naway from the joys of life.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,\\n\\nadvancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the\\n\\ncrevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his\\n\\nstature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was\\n\\ntroubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me,\\n\\nbut I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. I\\n\\nperceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)\\n\\nthat it was the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage and\\n\\nhorror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in\\n\\nmortal combat. He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish,\\n\\ncombined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness\\n\\nrendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely\\n\\nobserved this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance,\\n\\nand I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious\\n\\ndetestation and contempt.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Devil,” I exclaimed, “do you dare approach me? And do\\n\\nnot you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?\\n\\nBegone, vile insect! Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust! And,\\n\\noh! That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore\\n\\nthose victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I expected this reception,” said the dæmon. “All men hate the\\n\\nwretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all\\n\\nliving things! Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature,\\n\\nto whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of\\n\\none of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life?\\n\\nDo your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of\\n\\nmankind. If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and\\n\\nyou at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it\\n\\nbe satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Abhorred monster! Fiend that thou art! The tortures of hell are too\\n\\nmild a vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! You reproach me with\\n\\nyour creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I\\n\\nso negligently bestowed.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMy rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the\\n\\nfeelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe easily eluded me and said,\\n\\n\\n\\n“Be calm! I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred\\n\\non my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to\\n\\nincrease my misery? Life, although it may only be an accumulation of\\n\\nanguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember, thou hast made\\n\\nme more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my\\n\\njoints more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself in\\n\\nopposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and\\n\\ndocile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part,\\n\\nthe which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every\\n\\nother and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy\\n\\nclemency and affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature;\\n\\nI ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou\\n\\ndrivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I\\n\\nalone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made\\n\\nme a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between you\\n\\nand me; we are enemies. Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight,\\n\\nin which one must fall.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a\\n\\nfavourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and\\n\\ncompassion? Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed\\n\\nwith love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my\\n\\ncreator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures,\\n\\nwho owe me nothing? They spurn and hate me. The desert mountains and\\n\\ndreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; the\\n\\ncaves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the\\n\\nonly one which man does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they\\n\\nare kinder to me than your fellow beings. If the multitude of mankind\\n\\nknew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for\\n\\nmy destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I will keep\\n\\nno terms with my enemies. I am miserable, and they shall share my\\n\\nwretchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver\\n\\nthem from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that\\n\\nnot only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be\\n\\nswallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. Let your compassion be\\n\\nmoved, and do not disdain me. Listen to my tale; when you have heard\\n\\nthat, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve.\\n\\nBut hear me. The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they\\n\\nare, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned. Listen\\n\\nto me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with\\n\\na satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the\\n\\neternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me,\\n\\nand then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why do you call to my remembrance,” I rejoined, “circumstances of\\n\\nwhich I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and\\n\\nauthor? Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw\\n\\nlight! Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you!\\n\\nYou have made me wretched beyond expression. You have left me no power\\n\\nto consider whether I am just to you or not. Begone! Relieve me from\\n\\nthe sight of your detested form.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Thus I relieve thee, my creator,” he said, and placed his hated hands\\n\\nbefore my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; “thus I take from\\n\\nthee a sight which you abhor. Still thou canst listen to me and grant\\n\\nme thy compassion. By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this\\n\\nfrom you. Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of\\n\\nthis place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon\\n\\nthe mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends\\n\\nto hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another\\n\\nworld, you will have heard my story and can decide. On you it rests,\\n\\nwhether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless\\n\\nlife, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of\\n\\nyour own speedy ruin.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed. My heart\\n\\nwas full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the\\n\\nvarious arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to\\n\\nhis tale. I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my\\n\\nresolution. I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my\\n\\nbrother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.\\n\\nFor the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards\\n\\nhis creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I\\n\\ncomplained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with\\n\\nhis demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite\\n\\nrock. The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we\\n\\nentered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy\\n\\nheart and depressed spirits. But I consented to listen, and seating\\n\\nmyself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began\\n\\nhis tale.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 11\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of\\n\\nmy being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.\\n\\nA strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard,\\n\\nand smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I\\n\\nlearned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By\\n\\ndegrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I\\n\\nwas obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me and troubled\\n\\nme, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now\\n\\nsuppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked and, I believe,\\n\\ndescended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.\\n\\nBefore, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my\\n\\ntouch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with\\n\\nno obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The light\\n\\nbecame more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I\\n\\nwalked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the\\n\\nforest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting\\n\\nfrom my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This\\n\\nroused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I\\n\\nfound hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst\\n\\nat the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it\\n\\nwere, instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted\\n\\nyour apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some\\n\\nclothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of\\n\\nnight. I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could\\n\\ndistinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat\\n\\ndown and wept.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of\\n\\npleasure. I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the\\n\\ntrees. [The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly,\\n\\nbut it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries.\\n\\nI was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with\\n\\nwhich I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. No distinct\\n\\nideas occupied my mind; all was confused. I felt light, and hunger,\\n\\nand thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on\\n\\nall sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could\\n\\ndistinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with\\n\\npleasure.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had\\n\\ngreatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each\\n\\nother. I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with\\n\\ndrink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted\\n\\nwhen I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my\\n\\nears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had\\n\\noften intercepted the light from my eyes. I began also to observe,\\n\\nwith greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the\\n\\nboundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. Sometimes I\\n\\ntried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.\\n\\nSometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the\\n\\nuncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into\\n\\nsilence again.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened\\n\\nform, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest. My\\n\\nsensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every\\n\\nday additional ideas. My eyes became accustomed to the light and to\\n\\nperceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from\\n\\nthe herb, and by degrees, one herb from another. I found that the\\n\\nsparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and\\n\\nthrush were sweet and enticing.\\n\\n\\n\\n“One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been\\n\\nleft by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the\\n\\nwarmth I experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live\\n\\nembers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange,\\n\\nI thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects! I\\n\\nexamined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be\\n\\ncomposed of wood. I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet\\n\\nand would not burn. I was pained at this and sat still watching the\\n\\noperation of the fire. The wet wood which I had placed near the heat\\n\\ndried and itself became inflamed. I reflected on this, and by touching\\n\\nthe various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in\\n\\ncollecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a\\n\\nplentiful supply of fire. When night came on and brought sleep with\\n\\nit, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I\\n\\ncovered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches\\n\\nupon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank\\n\\ninto sleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.\\n\\nI uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. I\\n\\nobserved this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the\\n\\nembers when they were nearly extinguished. When night came again I\\n\\nfound, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that\\n\\nthe discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found\\n\\nsome of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and\\n\\ntasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees. I\\n\\ntried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on\\n\\nthe live embers. I found that the berries were spoiled by this\\n\\noperation, and the nuts and roots much improved.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day\\n\\nsearching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When\\n\\nI found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto\\n\\ninhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be\\n\\nmore easily satisfied. In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the\\n\\nloss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how\\n\\nto reproduce it. I gave several hours to the serious consideration of\\n\\nthis difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply\\n\\nit, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood\\n\\ntowards the setting sun. I passed three days in these rambles and at\\n\\nlength discovered the open country. A great fall of snow had taken\\n\\nplace the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the\\n\\nappearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold\\n\\ndamp substance that covered the ground.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and\\n\\nshelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which\\n\\nhad doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. This\\n\\nwas a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great\\n\\ncuriosity. Finding the door open, I entered. An old man sat in it,\\n\\nnear a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. He turned on\\n\\nhearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the\\n\\nhut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form\\n\\nhardly appeared capable. His appearance, different from any I had ever\\n\\nbefore seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted\\n\\nby the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not\\n\\npenetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite\\n\\nand divine a retreat as Pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell\\n\\nafter their sufferings in the lake of fire. I greedily devoured the\\n\\nremnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese,\\n\\nmilk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like. Then, overcome by\\n\\nfatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which\\n\\nshone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my\\n\\ntravels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in a\\n\\nwallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until\\n\\nat sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did this appear! The\\n\\nhuts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by\\n\\nturns. The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw\\n\\nplaced at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One\\n\\nof the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within\\n\\nthe door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.\\n\\nThe whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,\\n\\ngrievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I\\n\\nescaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,\\n\\nquite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had\\n\\nbeheld in the village. This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat\\n\\nand pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I\\n\\ndared not enter it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so\\n\\nlow that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however,\\n\\nwas placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and\\n\\nalthough the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an\\n\\nagreeable asylum from the snow and rain.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter,\\n\\nhowever miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more\\n\\nfrom the barbarity of man. As soon as morning dawned I crept from my\\n\\nkennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could\\n\\nremain in the habitation I had found. It was situated against the back\\n\\nof the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig\\n\\nsty and a clear pool of water. One part was open, and by that I had\\n\\ncrept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived\\n\\nwith stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on\\n\\noccasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and\\n\\nthat was sufficient for me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I\\n\\nretired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered\\n\\ntoo well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power. I\\n\\nhad first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf\\n\\nof coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink\\n\\nmore conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by\\n\\nmy retreat. The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept\\n\\nperfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was\\n\\ntolerably warm.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until\\n\\nsomething should occur which might alter my determination. It was\\n\\nindeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,\\n\\nthe rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with\\n\\npleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little\\n\\nwater when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld\\n\\na young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The\\n\\ngirl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found\\n\\ncottagers and farmhouse servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a\\n\\ncoarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair\\n\\nhair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. I lost\\n\\nsight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing\\n\\nthe pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along,\\n\\nseemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose\\n\\ncountenance expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds with\\n\\nan air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the\\n\\ncottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared. Presently I saw\\n\\nthe young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field\\n\\nbehind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the\\n\\nhouse and sometimes in the yard.\\n\\n\\n\\n“On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the\\n\\ncottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been\\n\\nfilled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost\\n\\nimperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.\\n\\nThrough this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean\\n\\nbut very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an\\n\\nold man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. The\\n\\nyoung girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she\\n\\ntook something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat\\n\\ndown beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play\\n\\nand to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the\\n\\nnightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had\\n\\nnever beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent\\n\\ncountenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle\\n\\nmanners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air\\n\\nwhich I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of\\n\\nwhich the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then\\n\\npronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt\\n\\nat his feet. He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection\\n\\nthat I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were\\n\\na mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced,\\n\\neither from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the\\n\\nwindow, unable to bear these emotions.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a\\n\\nload of wood. The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of\\n\\nhis burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on\\n\\nthe fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage,\\n\\nand he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed\\n\\npleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she\\n\\nplaced in water, and then upon the fire. She afterwards continued her\\n\\nwork, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily\\n\\nemployed in digging and pulling up roots. After he had been employed\\n\\nthus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the\\n\\ncottage together.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance\\n\\nof his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to\\n\\neat. The meal was quickly dispatched. The young woman was again\\n\\noccupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the\\n\\ncottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.\\n\\nNothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent\\n\\ncreatures. One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming\\n\\nwith benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his\\n\\nfigure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his\\n\\neyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. The\\n\\nold man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different\\n\\nfrom those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the\\n\\nfields.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the\\n\\ncottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was\\n\\ndelighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the\\n\\npleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours. In the evening\\n\\nthe young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations\\n\\nwhich I did not understand; and the old man again took up the\\n\\ninstrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in\\n\\nthe morning. So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play,\\n\\nbut to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the\\n\\nharmony of the old man’s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since\\n\\nfound that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the\\n\\nscience of words or letters.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time,\\n\\nextinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 12\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the\\n\\noccurrences of the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners\\n\\nof these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not. I\\n\\nremembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from\\n\\nthe barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I\\n\\nmight hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would\\n\\nremain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the\\n\\nmotives which influenced their actions.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The young woman\\n\\narranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed\\n\\nafter the first meal.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.\\n\\nThe young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in\\n\\nvarious laborious occupations within. The old man, whom I soon\\n\\nperceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or\\n\\nin contemplation. Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the\\n\\nyounger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion. They\\n\\nperformed towards him every little office of affection and duty with\\n\\ngentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.\\n\\n\\n\\n“They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often\\n\\nwent apart and appeared to weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness,\\n\\nbut I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely creatures were\\n\\nmiserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being,\\n\\nshould be wretched. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? They\\n\\npossessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every\\n\\nluxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands\\n\\nwhen hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,\\n\\nthey enjoyed one another’s company and speech, interchanging each day\\n\\nlooks of affection and kindness. What did their tears imply? Did they\\n\\nreally express pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions,\\n\\nbut perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which\\n\\nwere at first enigmatic.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of\\n\\nthe uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they\\n\\nsuffered that evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishment\\n\\nconsisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of\\n\\none cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters\\n\\ncould scarcely procure food to support it. They often, I believe,\\n\\nsuffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two\\n\\nyounger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old\\n\\nman when they reserved none for themselves.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed,\\n\\nduring the night, to steal a part of their store for my own\\n\\nconsumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on\\n\\nthe cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and\\n\\nroots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist\\n\\ntheir labours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day\\n\\nin collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often\\n\\ntook his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home\\n\\nfiring sufficient for the consumption of several days.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she\\n\\nopened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great\\n\\npile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the\\n\\nyouth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure,\\n\\nthat he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the\\n\\ncottage and cultivating the garden.\\n\\n\\n\\n“By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that\\n\\nthese people possessed a method of communicating their experience and\\n\\nfeelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words\\n\\nthey spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the\\n\\nminds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science,\\n\\nand I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in\\n\\nevery attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and\\n\\nthe words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible\\n\\nobjects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the\\n\\nmystery of their reference. By great application, however, and after having\\n\\nremained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I\\n\\ndiscovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of\\n\\ndiscourse; I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and\\n\\n_wood._ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth\\n\\nand his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only\\n\\none, which was _father._ The girl was called _sister_ or\\n\\n_Agatha,_ and the youth _Felix, brother,_ or _son_. I cannot\\n\\ndescribe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of\\n\\nthese sounds and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other\\n\\nwords without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good,\\n\\ndearest, unhappy._\\n\\n\\n\\n“I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of\\n\\nthe cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I\\n\\nfelt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. I saw\\n\\nfew human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the\\n\\ncottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the\\n\\nsuperior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive,\\n\\noften endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that\\n\\nhe called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a\\n\\ncheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure\\n\\neven upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled\\n\\nwith tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I\\n\\ngenerally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after\\n\\nhaving listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus\\n\\nwith Felix. He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my\\n\\nunpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his\\n\\nfriends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more\\n\\ncheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old\\n\\nman.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked\\n\\nthe dispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty\\n\\nand want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little\\n\\nwhite flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in\\n\\nthe morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that\\n\\nobstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and\\n\\nbrought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual\\n\\nastonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible\\n\\nhand. In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring\\n\\nfarmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner,\\n\\nyet brought no wood with him. At other times he worked in the garden,\\n\\nbut as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old\\n\\nman and Agatha.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I\\n\\ndiscovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when\\n\\nhe talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs\\n\\nfor speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend\\n\\nthese also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand\\n\\nthe sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved, however,\\n\\nsensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of\\n\\nconversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I\\n\\neasily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to\\n\\nthe cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become\\n\\nmaster of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them\\n\\noverlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast\\n\\nperpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty,\\n\\nand delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself\\n\\nin a transparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe that\\n\\nit was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became\\n\\nfully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was\\n\\nfilled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.\\n\\nAlas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable\\n\\ndeformity.\\n\\n\\n\\n“As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow\\n\\nvanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. From this\\n\\ntime Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of\\n\\nimpending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, was\\n\\ncoarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.\\n\\nSeveral new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they\\n\\ndressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season\\n\\nadvanced.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did\\n\\nnot rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its\\n\\nwaters. This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the\\n\\nearth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.\\n\\n\\n\\n“My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I\\n\\nattended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in\\n\\nvarious occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in\\n\\nobserving my friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was any\\n\\nmoon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected\\n\\nmy own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it\\n\\nwas necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those\\n\\noffices that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards found that these\\n\\nlabours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and\\n\\nonce or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _good\\n\\nspirit, wonderful_; but I did not then understand the signification\\n\\nof these terms.\\n\\n\\n\\n“My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the\\n\\nmotives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to\\n\\nknow why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad. I thought\\n\\n(foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to\\n\\nthese deserving people. When I slept or was absent, the forms of the\\n\\nvenerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix\\n\\nflitted before me. I looked upon them as superior beings who would be\\n\\nthe arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in my imagination a\\n\\nthousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of\\n\\nme. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle\\n\\ndemeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and\\n\\nafterwards their love.\\n\\n\\n\\n“These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to\\n\\nthe acquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but\\n\\nsupple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their\\n\\ntones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.\\n\\nIt was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose\\n\\nintentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved\\n\\nbetter treatment than blows and execration.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the\\n\\naspect of the earth. Men who before this change seemed to have been\\n\\nhid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of\\n\\ncultivation. The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves\\n\\nbegan to bud forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! Fit habitation\\n\\nfor gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and\\n\\nunwholesome. My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of\\n\\nnature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil,\\n\\nand the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 13\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I now hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall relate\\n\\nevents that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been,\\n\\nhave made me what I am.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies\\n\\ncloudless. It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy\\n\\nshould now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. My\\n\\nsenses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and\\n\\na thousand sights of beauty.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested\\n\\nfrom labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children\\n\\nlistened to him—that I observed the countenance of Felix was\\n\\nmelancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father\\n\\npaused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired\\n\\nthe cause of his son’s sorrow. Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and\\n\\nthe old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide.\\n\\nThe lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black\\n\\nveil. Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by\\n\\npronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice was\\n\\nmusical but unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word,\\n\\nFelix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her\\n\\nveil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. Her\\n\\nhair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were\\n\\ndark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular\\n\\nproportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with\\n\\na lovely pink.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of\\n\\nsorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of\\n\\necstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his\\n\\neyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I\\n\\nthought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by\\n\\ndifferent feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held\\n\\nout her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as\\n\\nwell as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to\\n\\nunderstand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and\\n\\ndismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some\\n\\nconversation took place between him and his father, and the young\\n\\nstranger knelt at the old man’s feet and would have kissed his hand,\\n\\nbut he raised her and embraced her affectionately.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds\\n\\nand appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood\\n\\nby nor herself understood the cottagers. They made many signs which I\\n\\ndid not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness\\n\\nthrough the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the\\n\\nmorning mists. Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of\\n\\ndelight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed\\n\\nthe hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made\\n\\nsigns which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she\\n\\ncame. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances,\\n\\nexpressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I\\n\\nfound, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger\\n\\nrepeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language;\\n\\nand the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the\\n\\nsame instructions to the same end. The stranger learned about twenty\\n\\nwords at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had\\n\\nbefore understood, but I profited by the others.\\n\\n\\n\\n“As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When they\\n\\nseparated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, ‘Good night\\n\\nsweet Safie.’ He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and\\n\\nby the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely\\n\\nguest was the subject of their conversation. I ardently desired to\\n\\nunderstand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found\\n\\nit utterly impossible.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual\\n\\noccupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the\\n\\nold man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly\\n\\nbeautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my\\n\\neyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or\\n\\ndying away like a nightingale of the woods.\\n\\n\\n\\n“When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first\\n\\ndeclined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in\\n\\nsweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old\\n\\nman appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to\\n\\nexplain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she\\n\\nbestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration\\n\\nthat joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.\\n\\nSafie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the\\n\\nknowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most\\n\\nof the words uttered by my protectors.\\n\\n\\n\\n“In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and\\n\\nthe green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the\\n\\nscent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods;\\n\\nthe sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal\\n\\nrambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably\\n\\nshortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never\\n\\nventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same\\n\\ntreatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.\\n\\n\\n\\n“My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily\\n\\nmaster the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than\\n\\nthe Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken\\n\\naccents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that\\n\\nwas spoken.\\n\\n\\n\\n“While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as\\n\\nit was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field\\n\\nfor wonder and delight.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney’s _Ruins\\n\\nof Empires_. I should not have understood the purport of this book had not\\n\\nFelix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this\\n\\nwork, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the\\n\\nEastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history\\n\\nand a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave\\n\\nme an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different\\n\\nnations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous\\n\\ngenius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue\\n\\nof the early Romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the\\n\\ndecline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard\\n\\nof the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the\\n\\nhapless fate of its original inhabitants.\\n\\n\\n\\n“These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was\\n\\nman, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so\\n\\nvicious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil\\n\\nprinciple and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and\\n\\ngodlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour\\n\\nthat can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on\\n\\nrecord have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more\\n\\nabject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long time I\\n\\ncould not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or\\n\\neven why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of\\n\\nvice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and\\n\\nloathing.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.\\n\\nWhile I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the\\n\\nArabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. I\\n\\nheard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid\\n\\npoverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the\\n\\npossessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and\\n\\nunsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with\\n\\nonly one of these advantages, but without either he was considered,\\n\\nexcept in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to\\n\\nwaste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And what was I? Of\\n\\nmy creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I\\n\\npossessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides,\\n\\nendued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even\\n\\nof the same nature as man. I was more agile than they and could\\n\\nsubsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with\\n\\nless injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked\\n\\naround I saw and heard of none like me. Was I, then, a monster, a blot\\n\\nupon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?\\n\\n\\n\\n“I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted\\n\\nupon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with\\n\\nknowledge. Oh, that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor\\n\\nknown nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!\\n\\n\\n\\n“Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind when it\\n\\nhas once seized on it like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to\\n\\nshake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one\\n\\nmeans to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death—a state\\n\\nwhich I feared yet did not understand. I admired virtue and good\\n\\nfeelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my\\n\\ncottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except\\n\\nthrough means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and\\n\\nunknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of\\n\\nbecoming one among my fellows. The gentle words of Agatha and the\\n\\nanimated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me. The mild\\n\\nexhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved\\n\\nFelix were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch!\\n\\n\\n\\n“Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard of the\\n\\ndifference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the\\n\\nfather doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the\\n\\nolder child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up\\n\\nin the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained\\n\\nknowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which\\n\\nbind one human being to another in mutual bonds.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my\\n\\ninfant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if\\n\\nthey had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I\\n\\ndistinguished nothing. From my earliest remembrance I had been as I\\n\\nthen was in height and proportion. I had never yet seen a being\\n\\nresembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me. What was I? The\\n\\nquestion again recurred, to be answered only with groans.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to\\n\\nreturn to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various\\n\\nfeelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated\\n\\nin additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in\\n\\nan innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 14\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. It was\\n\\none which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding\\n\\nas it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to\\n\\none so utterly inexperienced as I was.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a good\\n\\nfamily in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence,\\n\\nrespected by his superiors and beloved by his equals. His son was bred\\n\\nin the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the\\n\\nhighest distinction. A few months before my arrival they had lived in\\n\\na large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and\\n\\npossessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or\\n\\ntaste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was a\\n\\nTurkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some\\n\\nreason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government.\\n\\nHe was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from\\n\\nConstantinople to join him. He was tried and condemned to death. The\\n\\ninjustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant;\\n\\nand it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime\\n\\nalleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and\\n\\nindignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the\\n\\ncourt. He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then\\n\\nlooked around for the means. After many fruitless attempts to gain\\n\\nadmittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an\\n\\nunguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the\\n\\nunfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the\\n\\nexecution of the barbarous sentence. Felix visited the grate at night\\n\\nand made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. The Turk,\\n\\namazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer\\n\\nby promises of reward and wealth. Felix rejected his offers with\\n\\ncontempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit\\n\\nher father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the\\n\\nyouth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed\\n\\na treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made\\n\\non the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in\\n\\nhis interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he\\n\\nshould be conveyed to a place of safety. Felix was too delicate to\\n\\naccept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the\\n\\nevent as to the consummation of his happiness.\\n\\n\\n\\n“During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for\\n\\nthe escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several\\n\\nletters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to\\n\\nexpress her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old\\n\\nman, a servant of her father who understood French. She thanked him in\\n\\nthe most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and\\n\\nat the same time she gently deplored her own fate.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence\\n\\nin the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters\\n\\nwere often in the hands of Felix or Agatha. Before I depart I will\\n\\ngive them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present,\\n\\nas the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat\\n\\nthe substance of them to you.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a\\n\\nslave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of\\n\\nthe father of Safie, who married her. The young girl spoke in high and\\n\\nenthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the\\n\\nbondage to which she was now reduced. She instructed her daughter in\\n\\nthe tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of\\n\\nintellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female\\n\\nfollowers of Muhammad. This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly\\n\\nimpressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again\\n\\nreturning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem,\\n\\nallowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to\\n\\nthe temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble\\n\\nemulation for virtue. The prospect of marrying a Christian and\\n\\nremaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in\\n\\nsociety was enchanting to her.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night\\n\\nprevious to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant\\n\\nmany leagues from Paris. Felix had procured passports in the name of\\n\\nhis father, sister, and himself. He had previously communicated his\\n\\nplan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under\\n\\nthe pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in\\n\\nan obscure part of Paris.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont\\n\\nCenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable\\n\\nopportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his\\n\\ndeparture, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she\\n\\nshould be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in\\n\\nexpectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society\\n\\nof the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest\\n\\naffection. They conversed with one another through the means of an\\n\\ninterpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie\\n\\nsang to him the divine airs of her native country.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes\\n\\nof the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other\\n\\nplans. He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a\\n\\nChristian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear\\n\\nlukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer\\n\\nif he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they\\n\\ninhabited. He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled\\n\\nto prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and\\n\\nsecretly to take his daughter with him when he departed. His plans\\n\\nwere facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their\\n\\nvictim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. The\\n\\nplot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were\\n\\nthrown into prison. The news reached Felix and roused him from his\\n\\ndream of pleasure. His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay\\n\\nin a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of\\n\\nher whom he loved. This idea was torture to him. He quickly arranged\\n\\nwith the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity\\n\\nfor escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a\\n\\nboarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian,\\n\\nhe hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the\\n\\nlaw, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.\\n\\n\\n\\n“He did not succeed. They remained confined for five months before the\\n\\ntrial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune\\n\\nand condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.\\n\\n\\n\\n“They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I\\n\\ndiscovered them. Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for\\n\\nwhom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on\\n\\ndiscovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin,\\n\\nbecame a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with\\n\\nhis daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him,\\n\\nas he said, in some plan of future maintenance.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered\\n\\nhim, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family. He could\\n\\nhave endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his\\n\\nvirtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss\\n\\nof his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. The\\n\\narrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.\\n\\n\\n\\n“When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth\\n\\nand rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her\\n\\nlover, but to prepare to return to her native country. The generous\\n\\nnature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to\\n\\nexpostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his\\n\\ntyrannical mandate.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter’s apartment and told\\n\\nher hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn\\n\\nhad been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the\\n\\nFrench government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to\\n\\nConstantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours. He\\n\\nintended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential\\n\\nservant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his\\n\\nproperty, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.\\n\\n\\n\\n“When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it\\n\\nwould become her to pursue in this emergency. A residence in Turkey\\n\\nwas abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse\\n\\nto it. By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she\\n\\nheard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where\\n\\nhe then resided. She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her\\n\\ndetermination. Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a\\n\\nsum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn,\\n\\nbut who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for\\n\\nGermany.\\n\\n\\n\\n“She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage\\n\\nof De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill. Safie nursed her\\n\\nwith the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the\\n\\nArabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country\\n\\nand utterly ignorant of the customs of the world. She fell, however,\\n\\ninto good hands. The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for\\n\\nwhich they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in\\n\\nwhich they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at\\n\\nthe cottage of her lover.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 15\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Such was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me deeply.\\n\\nI learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire\\n\\ntheir virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.\\n\\n\\n\\n“As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and\\n\\ngenerosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to\\n\\nbecome an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities\\n\\nwere called forth and displayed. But in giving an account of the\\n\\nprogress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred\\n\\nin the beginning of the month of August of the same year.\\n\\n\\n\\n“One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I\\n\\ncollected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on\\n\\nthe ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and\\n\\nsome books. I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel. \\n\\nFortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I\\n\\nhad acquired at the cottage; they consisted of _Paradise Lost_, a volume\\n\\nof _Plutarch’s Lives_, and the _Sorrows of Werter_. The\\n\\npossession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually\\n\\nstudied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were\\n\\nemployed in their ordinary occupations.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced\\n\\nin me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me\\n\\nto ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In\\n\\nthe _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting\\n\\nstory, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon\\n\\nwhat had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a\\n\\nnever-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle and\\n\\ndomestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and\\n\\nfeelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded\\n\\nwell with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which\\n\\nwere for ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a\\n\\nmore divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character\\n\\ncontained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upon\\n\\ndeath and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not\\n\\npretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards\\n\\nthe opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely\\n\\nunderstanding it.\\n\\n\\n\\n“As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and\\n\\ncondition. I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely\\n\\nunlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I\\n\\nwas a listener. I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I\\n\\nwas unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.\\n\\n‘The path of my departure was free,’ and there was none to lament my\\n\\nannihilation. My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. What did\\n\\nthis mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my\\n\\ndestination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to\\n\\nsolve them.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The volume of _Plutarch’s Lives_ which I possessed contained the\\n\\nhistories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book\\n\\nhad a far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_. I\\n\\nlearned from Werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch\\n\\ntaught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my\\n\\nown reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many\\n\\nthings I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a very\\n\\nconfused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,\\n\\nand boundless seas. But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and\\n\\nlarge assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the\\n\\nonly school in which I had studied human nature, but this book\\n\\ndeveloped new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men concerned\\n\\nin public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the\\n\\ngreatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as\\n\\nfar as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they\\n\\nwere, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these\\n\\nfeelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa,\\n\\nSolon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The\\n\\npatriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a\\n\\nfirm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had\\n\\nbeen made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should\\n\\nhave been imbued with different sensations.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But _Paradise Lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions. I read\\n\\nit, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as\\n\\na true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the\\n\\npicture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of\\n\\nexciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity\\n\\nstruck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to\\n\\nany other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine\\n\\nin every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a\\n\\nperfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of\\n\\nhis Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from\\n\\nbeings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.\\n\\nMany times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for\\n\\noften, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter\\n\\ngall of envy rose within me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon\\n\\nafter my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of\\n\\nthe dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had\\n\\nneglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in\\n\\nwhich they were written, I began to study them with diligence. It was\\n\\nyour journal of the four months that preceded my creation. You\\n\\nminutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress\\n\\nof your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic\\n\\noccurrences. You doubtless recollect these papers. Here they are.\\n\\nEverything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed\\n\\norigin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances\\n\\nwhich produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious\\n\\nand loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own\\n\\nhorrors and rendered mine indelible. I sickened as I read. ‘Hateful\\n\\nday when I received life!’ I exclaimed in agony. ‘Accursed creator!\\n\\nWhy did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in\\n\\ndisgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own\\n\\nimage; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the\\n\\nvery resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire\\n\\nand encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.’\\n\\n\\n\\n“These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude;\\n\\nbut when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and\\n\\nbenevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should\\n\\nbecome acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would\\n\\ncompassionate me and overlook my personal deformity. Could they turn\\n\\nfrom their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion\\n\\nand friendship? I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way\\n\\nto fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. I\\n\\npostponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance\\n\\nattached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.\\n\\nBesides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every\\n\\nday’s experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking\\n\\nuntil a few more months should have added to my sagacity.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. The\\n\\npresence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also\\n\\nfound that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha\\n\\nspent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in\\n\\ntheir labours by servants. They did not appear rich, but they were\\n\\ncontented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while\\n\\nmine became every day more tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only\\n\\ndiscovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I\\n\\ncherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person\\n\\nreflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail\\n\\nimage and that inconstant shade.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial\\n\\nwhich in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my\\n\\nthoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and\\n\\ndared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my\\n\\nfeelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed\\n\\nsmiles of consolation. But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my\\n\\nsorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone. I remembered Adam’s\\n\\nsupplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had abandoned me,\\n\\nand in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay\\n\\nand fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it\\n\\nhad worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did\\n\\nnot heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my\\n\\nconformation for the endurance of cold than heat. But my chief\\n\\ndelights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay\\n\\napparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention\\n\\ntowards the cottagers. Their happiness was not decreased by the\\n\\nabsence of summer. They loved and sympathised with one another; and\\n\\ntheir joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the\\n\\ncasualties that took place around them. The more I saw of them, the\\n\\ngreater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my\\n\\nheart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see\\n\\ntheir sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost\\n\\nlimit of my ambition. I dared not think that they would turn them from\\n\\nme with disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door were\\n\\nnever driven away. I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a\\n\\nlittle food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not\\n\\nbelieve myself utterly unworthy of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken\\n\\nplace since I awoke into life. My attention at this time was solely\\n\\ndirected towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my\\n\\nprotectors. I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally\\n\\nfixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.\\n\\nI had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my\\n\\nperson was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly\\n\\nbeheld me. My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I\\n\\nthought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain\\n\\nthe good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means\\n\\nbe tolerated by my younger protectors.\\n\\n\\n\\n“One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground\\n\\nand diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha,\\n\\nand Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own\\n\\ndesire, was left alone in the cottage. When his children had departed,\\n\\nhe took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more\\n\\nsweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before. At first his\\n\\ncountenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued,\\n\\nthoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the\\n\\ninstrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.\\n\\n\\n\\n“My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which\\n\\nwould decide my hopes or realise my fears. The servants were gone to a\\n\\nneighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an\\n\\nexcellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my\\n\\nlimbs failed me and I sank to the ground. Again I rose, and exerting\\n\\nall the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had\\n\\nplaced before my hovel to conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived\\n\\nme, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their\\n\\ncottage.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I knocked. ‘Who is there?’ said the old man. ‘Come in.’\\n\\n\\n\\n“I entered. ‘Pardon this intrusion,’ said I; ‘I am\\n\\na traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you\\n\\nwould allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.’\\n\\n\\n\\n“‘Enter,’ said De Lacey, ‘and I will try in what\\n\\nmanner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are\\n\\nfrom home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to\\n\\nprocure food for you.’\\n\\n\\n\\n“‘Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is\\n\\nwarmth and rest only that I need.’\\n\\n\\n\\n“I sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that every minute was\\n\\nprecious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence\\n\\nthe interview, when the old man addressed me.\\n\\n\\n\\n‘By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you\\n\\nFrench?’\\n\\n\\n\\n“‘No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that\\n\\nlanguage only. I am now going to claim the protection of some friends,\\n\\nwhom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.’\\n\\n\\n\\n“‘Are they Germans?’\\n\\n\\n\\n“‘No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I am an\\n\\nunfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relation\\n\\nor friend upon earth. These amiable people to whom I go have never\\n\\nseen me and know little of me. I am full of fears, for if I fail\\n\\nthere, I am an outcast in the world for ever.’\\n\\n\\n\\n“‘Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but\\n\\nthe hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are\\n\\nfull of brotherly love and charity. Rely, therefore, on your hopes;\\n\\nand if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.’\\n\\n\\n\\n“‘They are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world;\\n\\nbut, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. I have good\\n\\ndispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree\\n\\nbeneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they\\n\\nought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable\\n\\nmonster.’\\n\\n\\n\\n“‘That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot\\n\\nyou undeceive them?’\\n\\n\\n\\n“‘I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I\\n\\nfeel so many overwhelming terrors. I tenderly love these friends; I\\n\\nhave, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily\\n\\nkindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and\\n\\nit is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.’\\n\\n\\n\\n“‘Where do these friends reside?’\\n\\n\\n\\n“‘Near this spot.’\\n\\n\\n\\n“The old man paused and then continued, ‘If you will unreservedly\\n\\nconfide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in\\n\\nundeceiving them. I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but\\n\\nthere is something in your words which persuades me that you are\\n\\nsincere. I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure\\n\\nto be in any way serviceable to a human creature.’\\n\\n\\n\\n“‘Excellent man! I thank you and accept your generous offer. You\\n\\nraise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid,\\n\\nI shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow\\n\\ncreatures.’\\n\\n\\n\\n“‘Heaven forbid! Even if you were really criminal, for that can only\\n\\ndrive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. I also am\\n\\nunfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent;\\n\\njudge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.’\\n\\n\\n\\n“‘How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From your lips\\n\\nfirst have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall\\n\\nbe for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success\\n\\nwith those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.’\\n\\n\\n\\n“‘May I know the names and residence of those friends?’\\n\\n\\n\\n“I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to\\n\\nrob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever. I struggled vainly for\\n\\nfirmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my\\n\\nremaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud. At that\\n\\nmoment I heard the steps of my younger protectors. I had not a moment\\n\\nto lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, ‘Now is the\\n\\ntime! Save and protect me! You and your family are the friends whom I\\n\\nseek. Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!’\\n\\n\\n\\n“‘Great God!’ exclaimed the old man. ‘Who are you?’\\n\\n\\n\\n“At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and\\n\\nAgatha entered. Who can describe their horror and consternation on\\n\\nbeholding me? Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her\\n\\nfriend, rushed out of the cottage. Felix darted forward, and with\\n\\nsupernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in\\n\\na transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently\\n\\nwith a stick. I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends\\n\\nthe antelope. But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and\\n\\nI refrained. I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when,\\n\\novercome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general\\n\\ntumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I\\n\\nnot extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly\\n\\nbestowed? I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my\\n\\nfeelings were those of rage and revenge. I could with pleasure have\\n\\ndestroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with\\n\\ntheir shrieks and misery.\\n\\n\\n\\n“When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and\\n\\nnow, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my\\n\\nanguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast that had broken\\n\\nthe toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging\\n\\nthrough the wood with a stag-like swiftness. Oh! What a miserable\\n\\nnight I passed! The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees\\n\\nwaved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird\\n\\nburst forth amidst the universal stillness. All, save I, were at rest\\n\\nor in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and\\n\\nfinding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread\\n\\nhavoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed\\n\\nthe ruin.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became\\n\\nfatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in\\n\\nthe sick impotence of despair. There was none among the myriads of men\\n\\nthat existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness\\n\\ntowards my enemies? No; from that moment I declared everlasting war\\n\\nagainst the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me\\n\\nand sent me forth to this insupportable misery.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was\\n\\nimpossible to return to my retreat during that day. Accordingly I hid\\n\\nmyself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours\\n\\nto reflection on my situation.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some\\n\\ndegree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the\\n\\ncottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my\\n\\nconclusions. I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that\\n\\nmy conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a\\n\\nfool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children. I\\n\\nought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to\\n\\nhave discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have\\n\\nbeen prepared for my approach. But I did not believe my errors to be\\n\\nirretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the\\n\\ncottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my\\n\\nparty.\\n\\n\\n\\n“These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound\\n\\nsleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by\\n\\npeaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever\\n\\nacting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix\\n\\ntearing me from his father’s feet. I awoke exhausted, and finding that\\n\\nit was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in\\n\\nsearch of food.\\n\\n\\n\\n“When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the\\n\\nwell-known path that conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace.\\n\\nI crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the\\n\\naccustomed hour when the family arose. That hour passed, the sun\\n\\nmounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear. I\\n\\ntrembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside\\n\\nof the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the\\n\\nagony of this suspense.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they\\n\\nentered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not\\n\\nunderstand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country,\\n\\nwhich differed from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix\\n\\napproached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not\\n\\nquitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from\\n\\nhis discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.\\n\\n\\n\\n“‘Do you consider,’ said his companion to him,\\n\\n‘that you will be obliged to pay three months’ rent and to lose\\n\\nthe produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and\\n\\nI beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your\\n\\ndetermination.’\\n\\n\\n\\n“‘It is utterly useless,’ replied Felix; ‘we can\\n\\nnever again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest\\n\\ndanger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and\\n\\nmy sister will never recover from their horror. I entreat you not to reason\\n\\nwith me any more. Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this\\n\\nplace.’\\n\\n\\n\\n“Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion\\n\\nentered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then\\n\\ndeparted. I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of\\n\\nutter and stupid despair. My protectors had departed and had broken\\n\\nthe only link that held me to the world. For the first time the\\n\\nfeelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to\\n\\ncontrol them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I\\n\\nbent my mind towards injury and death. When I thought of my friends,\\n\\nof the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the\\n\\nexquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of\\n\\ntears somewhat soothed me. But again when I reflected that they had\\n\\nspurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to\\n\\ninjure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As\\n\\nnight advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage,\\n\\nand after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden,\\n\\nI waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my\\n\\noperations.\\n\\n\\n\\n“As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly\\n\\ndispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore\\n\\nalong like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my\\n\\nspirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the\\n\\ndry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,\\n\\nmy eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon\\n\\nnearly touched. A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my\\n\\nbrand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath,\\n\\nand bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned the fire, and the\\n\\ncottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and\\n\\nlicked it with their forked and destroying tongues.\\n\\n\\n\\n“As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of\\n\\nthe habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I\\n\\nresolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated\\n\\nand despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the\\n\\nthought of you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you\\n\\nwere my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness\\n\\nthan to him who had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix had\\n\\nbestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from\\n\\nthese the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.\\n\\nYou had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards\\n\\nthis place I resolved to proceed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a\\n\\nsouthwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my\\n\\nonly guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass\\n\\nthrough, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I\\n\\ndid not despair. From you only could I hope for succour, although\\n\\ntowards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling,\\n\\nheartless creator! You had endowed me with perceptions and passions\\n\\nand then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.\\n\\nBut on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I\\n\\ndetermined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from\\n\\nany other being that wore the human form.\\n\\n\\n\\n“My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense. It was\\n\\nlate in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.\\n\\nI travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a\\n\\nhuman being. Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless;\\n\\nrain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface\\n\\nof the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh,\\n\\nearth! How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being! The\\n\\nmildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall\\n\\nand bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more\\n\\ndeeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow\\n\\nfell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents\\n\\nnow and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I\\n\\noften wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me\\n\\nno respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could\\n\\nnot extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived\\n\\non the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth\\n\\nand the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial\\n\\nmanner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was\\n\\nsecured by night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding\\n\\nthat my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey\\n\\nafter the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,\\n\\ncheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of\\n\\nthe air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long\\n\\nappeared dead, revive within me. Half surprised by the novelty of\\n\\nthese sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and\\n\\nforgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft tears\\n\\nagain bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with\\n\\nthankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its\\n\\nboundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many\\n\\nof the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.\\n\\nHere I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard\\n\\nthe sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade\\n\\nof a cypress. I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running\\n\\ntowards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from\\n\\nsomeone in sport. She continued her course along the precipitous sides\\n\\nof the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the\\n\\nrapid stream. I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour,\\n\\nfrom the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. She\\n\\nwas senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore\\n\\nanimation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,\\n\\nwho was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On\\n\\nseeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms,\\n\\nhastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I\\n\\nhardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun,\\n\\nwhich he carried, at my body and fired. I sank to the ground, and my\\n\\ninjurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being\\n\\nfrom destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable\\n\\npain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of\\n\\nkindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments\\n\\nbefore gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by\\n\\npain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. But the\\n\\nagony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.\\n\\n\\n\\n“For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to\\n\\ncure the wound which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder,\\n\\nand I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any\\n\\nrate I had no means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented\\n\\nalso by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their\\n\\ninfliction. My daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge,\\n\\nsuch as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had\\n\\nendured.\\n\\n\\n\\n“After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. The\\n\\nlabours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or\\n\\ngentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my\\n\\ndesolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for\\n\\nthe enjoyment of pleasure.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I\\n\\nreached the environs of Geneva.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among\\n\\nthe fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply\\n\\nto you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to\\n\\nenjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting\\n\\nbehind the stupendous mountains of Jura.\\n\\n\\n\\n“At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection,\\n\\nwhich was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came\\n\\nrunning into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of\\n\\ninfancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this\\n\\nlittle creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have\\n\\nimbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him and\\n\\neducate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in\\n\\nthis peopled earth.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him\\n\\ntowards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before\\n\\nhis eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his\\n\\nface and said, ‘Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to\\n\\nhurt you; listen to me.’\\n\\n\\n\\n“He struggled violently. ‘Let me go,’ he cried;\\n\\n‘monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. You\\n\\nare an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my papa.’\\n\\n\\n\\n“‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’\\n\\n\\n\\n“‘Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a syndic—he is M.\\n\\nFrankenstein—he will punish you. You dare not keep me.’\\n\\n\\n\\n“‘Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom I have\\n\\nsworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’\\n\\n\\n\\n“The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried\\n\\ndespair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a\\n\\nmoment he lay dead at my feet.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish\\n\\ntriumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, ‘I too can create desolation;\\n\\nmy enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and\\n\\na thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.’\\n\\n\\n\\n“As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his\\n\\nbreast. I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite\\n\\nof my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a few moments I\\n\\ngazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her\\n\\nlovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was\\n\\nfor ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could\\n\\nbestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in\\n\\nregarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one\\n\\nexpressive of disgust and affright.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I only\\n\\nwonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in\\n\\nexclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the\\n\\nattempt to destroy them.\\n\\n\\n\\n“While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had\\n\\ncommitted the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I\\n\\nentered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman was\\n\\nsleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her\\n\\nwhose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the\\n\\nloveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose\\n\\njoy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. And then I bent over\\n\\nher and whispered, ‘Awake, fairest, thy lover is near—he who would\\n\\ngive his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my\\n\\nbeloved, awake!’\\n\\n\\n\\n“The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she\\n\\nindeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus\\n\\nwould she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.\\n\\nThe thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me—not I, but\\n\\nshe, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am for ever\\n\\nrobbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime had\\n\\nits source in her; be hers the punishment! Thanks to the lessons of\\n\\nFelix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work\\n\\nmischief. I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of\\n\\nthe folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled.\\n\\n\\n\\n“For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place,\\n\\nsometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and\\n\\nits miseries for ever. At length I wandered towards these mountains,\\n\\nand have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning\\n\\npassion which you alone can gratify. We may not part until you have\\n\\npromised to comply with my requisition. I am alone and miserable; man\\n\\nwill not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself\\n\\nwould not deny herself to me. My companion must be of the same species\\n\\nand have the same defects. This being you must create.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 17\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the\\n\\nexpectation of a reply. But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to\\n\\narrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his\\n\\nproposition. He continued,\\n\\n\\n\\n“You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the\\n\\ninterchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone\\n\\ncan do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to\\n\\nconcede.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had\\n\\ndied away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and\\n\\nas he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within\\n\\nme.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I do refuse it,” I replied; “and no torture shall ever extort a\\n\\nconsent from me. You may render me the most miserable of men, but you\\n\\nshall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another like\\n\\nyourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I\\n\\nhave answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are in the wrong,” replied the fiend; “and instead\\n\\nof threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I\\n\\nam miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator,\\n\\nwould tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I\\n\\nshould pity man more than he pities me? You would not call it murder if you\\n\\ncould precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the\\n\\nwork of your own hands. Shall I respect man when he condemns me? Let him\\n\\nlive with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would\\n\\nbestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance.\\n\\nBut that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our\\n\\nunion. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. I will\\n\\nrevenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and\\n\\nchiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear\\n\\ninextinguishable hatred. Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor\\n\\nfinish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of\\n\\nyour birth.”\\n\\n\\n\\nA fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled\\n\\ninto contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently\\n\\nhe calmed himself and proceeded—\\n\\n\\n\\n“I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for you do\\n\\nnot reflect that _you_ are the cause of its excess. If any being felt\\n\\nemotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a\\n\\nhundredfold; for that one creature’s sake I would make peace with the\\n\\nwhole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised.\\n\\nWhat I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of\\n\\nanother sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it\\n\\nis all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be\\n\\nmonsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more\\n\\nattached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be\\n\\nharmless and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! My creator, make me\\n\\nhappy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I\\n\\nexcite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my\\n\\nrequest!”\\n\\n\\n\\nI was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences\\n\\nof my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.\\n\\nHis tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature\\n\\nof fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion\\n\\nof happiness that it was in my power to bestow? He saw my change of\\n\\nfeeling and continued,\\n\\n\\n\\n“If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see\\n\\nus again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America. My food is not\\n\\nthat of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite;\\n\\nacorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will\\n\\nbe of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare.\\n\\nWe shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on\\n\\nman and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful\\n\\nand human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the\\n\\nwantonness of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me,\\n\\nI now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment\\n\\nand persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You propose,” replied I, “to fly from the habitations of\\n\\nman, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your\\n\\nonly companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man,\\n\\npersevere in this exile? You will return and again seek their kindness, and\\n\\nyou will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed,\\n\\nand you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction.\\n\\nThis may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“How inconstant are your feelings! But a moment ago you were moved by\\n\\nmy representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?\\n\\nI swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that\\n\\nwith the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man and\\n\\ndwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil passions\\n\\nwill have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! My life will flow quietly\\n\\naway, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHis words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him and\\n\\nsometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when\\n\\nI saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my\\n\\nfeelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle\\n\\nthese sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathise with him, I\\n\\nhad no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which\\n\\nwas yet in my power to bestow.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You swear,” I said, “to be harmless; but have you not\\n\\nalready shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust\\n\\nyou? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by\\n\\naffording a wider scope for your revenge?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“How is this? I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer. If\\n\\nI have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion;\\n\\nthe love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall\\n\\nbecome a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant. My vices\\n\\nare the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will\\n\\nnecessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel\\n\\nthe affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of\\n\\nexistence and events from which I am now excluded.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various\\n\\narguments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which\\n\\nhe had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight\\n\\nof all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had\\n\\nmanifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my\\n\\ncalculations; a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers\\n\\nand hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices\\n\\nwas a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a\\n\\nlong pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and\\n\\nmy fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request.\\n\\nTurning to him, therefore, I said,\\n\\n\\n\\n“I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever,\\n\\nand every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall\\n\\ndeliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I swear,” he cried, “by the sun, and by the blue sky of\\n\\nheaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my\\n\\nprayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again. Depart to your\\n\\nhome and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress with\\n\\nunutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall\\n\\nappear.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSaying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in\\n\\nmy sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than\\n\\nthe flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the\\n\\nsea of ice.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of\\n\\nthe horizon when he departed. I knew that I ought to hasten my descent\\n\\ntowards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my\\n\\nheart was heavy, and my steps slow. The labour of winding among the\\n\\nlittle paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced\\n\\nperplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences\\n\\nof the day had produced. Night was far advanced when I came to the\\n\\nhalfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars\\n\\nshone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines\\n\\nrose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the\\n\\nground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange\\n\\nthoughts within me. I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I\\n\\nexclaimed, “Oh! stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock\\n\\nme; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as\\n\\nnought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThese were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you\\n\\nhow the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I\\n\\nlistened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its\\n\\nway to consume me.\\n\\n\\n\\nMorning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no\\n\\nrest, but returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart I could\\n\\ngive no expression to my sensations—they weighed on me with a\\n\\nmountain’s weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them.\\n\\nThus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the\\n\\nfamily. My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I\\n\\nanswered no question, scarcely did I speak. I felt as if I were placed\\n\\nunder a ban—as if I had no right to claim their sympathies—as if\\n\\nnever more might I enjoy companionship with them. Yet even thus I\\n\\nloved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate\\n\\nmyself to my most abhorred task. The prospect of such an occupation\\n\\nmade every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream,\\n\\nand that thought only had to me the reality of life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 18\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDay after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and\\n\\nI could not collect the courage to recommence my work. I feared the\\n\\nvengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my\\n\\nrepugnance to the task which was enjoined me. I found that I could not\\n\\ncompose a female without again devoting several months to profound\\n\\nstudy and laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries\\n\\nhaving been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was\\n\\nmaterial to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my\\n\\nfather’s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to\\n\\nevery pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an\\n\\nundertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to\\n\\nme. A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had\\n\\nhitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when\\n\\nunchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My\\n\\nfather saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts\\n\\ntowards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy,\\n\\nwhich every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring\\n\\nblackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took\\n\\nrefuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole days on the lake\\n\\nalone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the\\n\\nrippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air and\\n\\nbright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and\\n\\non my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile\\n\\nand a more cheerful heart.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was after my return from one of these rambles that my father,\\n\\ncalling me aside, thus addressed me,\\n\\n\\n\\n“I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former\\n\\npleasures and seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still\\n\\nunhappy and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in\\n\\nconjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me,\\n\\nand if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a\\n\\npoint would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued—\\n\\n\\n\\n“I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your\\n\\nmarriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the\\n\\nstay of my declining years. You were attached to each other from your\\n\\nearliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and\\n\\ntastes, entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of\\n\\nman that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have\\n\\nentirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any\\n\\nwish that she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another\\n\\nwhom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to\\n\\nElizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear\\n\\nto feel.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“My dear father, reassure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and\\n\\nsincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my\\n\\nwarmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects are\\n\\nentirely bound up in the expectation of our union.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor,\\n\\ngives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced. If you\\n\\nfeel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast\\n\\na gloom over us. But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so\\n\\nstrong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate. Tell me,\\n\\ntherefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the\\n\\nmarriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us\\n\\nfrom that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You\\n\\nare younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent\\n\\nfortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future\\n\\nplans of honour and utility that you may have formed. Do not suppose,\\n\\nhowever, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on\\n\\nyour part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words\\n\\nwith candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and\\n\\nsincerity.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable\\n\\nof offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of\\n\\nthoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! To me\\n\\nthe idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and\\n\\ndismay. I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled\\n\\nand dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not\\n\\nimpend over me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival\\n\\nwith this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the\\n\\nground? I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with\\n\\nhis mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from\\n\\nwhich I expected peace.\\n\\n\\n\\nI remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to\\n\\nEngland or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers\\n\\nof that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable\\n\\nuse to me in my present undertaking. The latter method of obtaining\\n\\nthe desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I\\n\\nhad an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my\\n\\nloathsome task in my father’s house while in habits of familiar\\n\\nintercourse with those I loved. I knew that a thousand fearful\\n\\naccidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to\\n\\nthrill all connected with me with horror. I was aware also that I\\n\\nshould often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the\\n\\nharrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my\\n\\nunearthly occupation. I must absent myself from all I loved while thus\\n\\nemployed. Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be\\n\\nrestored to my family in peace and happiness. My promise fulfilled,\\n\\nthe monster would depart for ever. Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some\\n\\naccident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my\\n\\nslavery for ever.\\n\\n\\n\\nThese feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to\\n\\nvisit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I\\n\\nclothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I\\n\\nurged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to\\n\\ncomply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that\\n\\nresembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find\\n\\nthat I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey,\\n\\nand he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my\\n\\nreturn, have restored me entirely to myself.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or\\n\\nat most a year, was the period contemplated. One paternal kind\\n\\nprecaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. Without\\n\\npreviously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth,\\n\\narranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh. This interfered\\n\\nwith the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the\\n\\ncommencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be\\n\\nan impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many\\n\\nhours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand between\\n\\nme and the intrusion of my foe. If I were alone, would he not at times\\n\\nforce his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to\\n\\ncontemplate its progress?\\n\\n\\n\\nTo England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union\\n\\nwith Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. My father’s\\n\\nage rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was one\\n\\nreward I promised myself from my detested toils—one consolation for my\\n\\nunparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when,\\n\\nenfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and\\n\\nforget the past in my union with her.\\n\\n\\n\\nI now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me\\n\\nwhich filled me with fear and agitation. During my absence I should\\n\\nleave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and\\n\\nunprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my\\n\\ndeparture. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and\\n\\nwould he not accompany me to England? This imagination was dreadful in\\n\\nitself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.\\n\\nI was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of\\n\\nthis might happen. But through the whole period during which I was the\\n\\nslave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of\\n\\nthe moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend\\n\\nwould follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his\\n\\nmachinations.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native\\n\\ncountry. My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth\\n\\ntherefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of\\n\\nmy suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief. It had\\n\\nbeen her care which provided me a companion in Clerval—and yet a man\\n\\nis blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman’s\\n\\nsedulous attention. She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand\\n\\nconflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent\\n\\nfarewell.\\n\\n\\n\\nI threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly\\n\\nknowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.\\n\\nI remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on\\n\\nit, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with\\n\\nme. Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful\\n\\nand majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could\\n\\nonly think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy\\n\\nme whilst they endured.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed\\n\\nmany leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for\\n\\nClerval. He came. Alas, how great was the contrast between us! He\\n\\nwas alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the\\n\\nsetting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new\\n\\nday. He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and\\n\\nthe appearances of the sky. “This is what it is to live,” he cried;\\n\\n“now I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are\\n\\nyou desponding and sorrowful!” In truth, I was occupied by gloomy\\n\\nthoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden\\n\\nsunrise reflected in the Rhine. And you, my friend, would be far more\\n\\namused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an\\n\\neye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections. I, a\\n\\nmiserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to\\n\\nenjoyment.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to\\n\\nRotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London. During this\\n\\nvoyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.\\n\\nWe stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from\\n\\nStrasburgh, arrived at Mainz. The course of the Rhine below Mainz\\n\\nbecomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly and winds\\n\\nbetween hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw\\n\\nmany ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by\\n\\nblack woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed,\\n\\npresents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you view\\n\\nrugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with\\n\\nthe dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,\\n\\nflourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river\\n\\nand populous towns occupy the scene.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers\\n\\nas we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits\\n\\ncontinually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the\\n\\nbottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to\\n\\ndrink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these\\n\\nwere my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had\\n\\nbeen transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by\\n\\nman. “I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenes\\n\\nof my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the\\n\\nsnowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black\\n\\nand impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance\\n\\nwere it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay\\n\\nappearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore\\n\\nup whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be\\n\\non the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain,\\n\\nwhere the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and\\n\\nwhere their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the\\n\\nnightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud;\\n\\nbut this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The\\n\\nmountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a\\n\\ncharm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.\\n\\nLook at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the\\n\\nisland, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now\\n\\nthat group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village\\n\\nhalf hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits\\n\\nand guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who\\n\\npile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of\\n\\nour own country.”\\n\\n\\n\\nClerval! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words and\\n\\nto dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a\\n\\nbeing formed in the “very poetry of nature.” His wild and\\n\\nenthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His\\n\\nsoul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that\\n\\ndevoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only\\n\\nin the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to\\n\\nsatisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard\\n\\nonly with admiration, he loved with ardour:—\\n\\n\\n\\n    ——The sounding cataract\\n\\n    Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,\\n\\n    The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,\\n\\n    Their colours and their forms, were then to him\\n\\n    An appetite; a feeling, and a love,\\n\\n    That had no need of a remoter charm,\\n\\n    By thought supplied, or any interest\\n\\n    Unborrow’d from the eye.\\n\\n\\n\\n          [Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey”.]\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost\\n\\nfor ever? Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful\\n\\nand magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the\\n\\nlife of its creator;—has this mind perished? Does it now only exist\\n\\nin my memory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and\\n\\nbeaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and\\n\\nconsoles your unhappy friend.\\n\\n\\n\\nPardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight\\n\\ntribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart,\\n\\noverflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. I will\\n\\nproceed with my tale.\\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to\\n\\npost the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of\\n\\nthe river was too gentle to aid us.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we\\n\\narrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.\\n\\nIt was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw\\n\\nthe white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene;\\n\\nthey were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the\\n\\nremembrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish\\n\\nArmada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich—places which I had heard\\n\\nof even in my country.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul’s towering\\n\\nabove all, and the Tower famed in English history.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 19\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLondon was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several\\n\\nmonths in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the\\n\\nintercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this\\n\\ntime, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally\\n\\noccupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the\\n\\ncompletion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of\\n\\nintroduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most\\n\\ndistinguished natural philosophers.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,\\n\\nit would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had\\n\\ncome over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of\\n\\nthe information they might give me on the subject in which my interest\\n\\nwas so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I\\n\\ncould fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of\\n\\nHenry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory\\n\\npeace. But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to\\n\\nmy heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my\\n\\nfellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and\\n\\nJustine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled\\n\\nmy soul with anguish.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive\\n\\nand anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of\\n\\nmanners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of\\n\\ninstruction and amusement. He was also pursuing an object he had long\\n\\nhad in view. His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had\\n\\nin his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had\\n\\ntaken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of\\n\\nEuropean colonization and trade. In Britain only could he further the\\n\\nexecution of his plan. He was for ever busy, and the only check to his\\n\\nenjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. I tried to conceal this\\n\\nas much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures\\n\\nnatural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by\\n\\nany care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him,\\n\\nalleging another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also\\n\\nbegan to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this\\n\\nwas to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling\\n\\non the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme\\n\\nanguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips\\n\\nto quiver, and my heart to palpitate.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in\\n\\nScotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the\\n\\nbeauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient\\n\\nallurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth,\\n\\nwhere he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I,\\n\\nalthough I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and\\n\\nall the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now\\n\\nFebruary. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the\\n\\nnorth at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not\\n\\nintend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford,\\n\\nMatlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of\\n\\nthis tour about the end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments and\\n\\nthe materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some\\n\\nobscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at\\n\\nWindsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us\\n\\nmountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of\\n\\nstately deer were all novelties to us.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds\\n\\nwere filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted\\n\\nthere more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles\\n\\nI. had collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him,\\n\\nafter the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of\\n\\nParliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king and his\\n\\ncompanions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and\\n\\nson, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they\\n\\nmight be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a\\n\\ndwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these\\n\\nfeelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of\\n\\nthe city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.\\n\\nThe colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost\\n\\nmagnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows\\n\\nof exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,\\n\\nwhich reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and\\n\\ndomes, embosomed among aged trees.\\n\\n\\n\\nI enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the\\n\\nmemory of the past and the anticipation of the future. I was formed\\n\\nfor peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never\\n\\nvisited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what\\n\\nis beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in\\n\\nthe productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate\\n\\nelasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has\\n\\nentered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what\\n\\nI shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,\\n\\npitiable to others and intolerable to myself.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs\\n\\nand endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most\\n\\nanimating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery\\n\\nwere often prolonged by the successive objects that presented\\n\\nthemselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the\\n\\nfield on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated\\n\\nfrom its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas\\n\\nof liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments\\n\\nand the remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains\\n\\nand look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten\\n\\ninto my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my\\n\\nmiserable self.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next\\n\\nplace of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village\\n\\nresembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but\\n\\neverything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of\\n\\ndistant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my\\n\\nnative country. We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets\\n\\nof natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same\\n\\nmanner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name\\n\\nmade me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit\\n\\nMatlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in\\n\\nCumberland and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the\\n\\nSwiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the\\n\\nnorthern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the\\n\\nrocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we\\n\\nmade some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into\\n\\nhappiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than\\n\\nmine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found\\n\\nin his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have\\n\\nimagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his\\n\\ninferiors. “I could pass my life here,” said he to me; “and among\\n\\nthese mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBut he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain\\n\\namidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and\\n\\nwhen he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit\\n\\nthat on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again\\n\\nengages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland\\n\\nand conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period\\n\\nof our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them\\n\\nto travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my\\n\\npromise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon’s\\n\\ndisappointment. He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance\\n\\non my relatives. This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment\\n\\nfrom which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited\\n\\nfor my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was\\n\\nmiserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I\\n\\nsaw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to\\n\\nread and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend\\n\\nfollowed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.\\n\\nWhen these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,\\n\\nbut followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of\\n\\nhis destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the\\n\\nconsciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed\\n\\ndrawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.\\n\\n\\n\\nI visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might\\n\\nhave interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well\\n\\nas Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.\\n\\nBut the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic\\n\\ncastle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’s\\n\\nSeat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for\\n\\nthe change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was\\n\\nimpatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew’s, and\\n\\nalong the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.\\n\\nBut I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into\\n\\ntheir feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and\\n\\naccordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland\\n\\nalone. “Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this be our\\n\\nrendezvous. I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with\\n\\nmy motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short\\n\\ntime; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more\\n\\ncongenial to your own temper.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHenry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to\\n\\nremonstrate. He entreated me to write often. “I had rather be with\\n\\nyou,” he said, “in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch\\n\\npeople, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return,\\n\\nthat I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in\\n\\nyour absence.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHaving parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of\\n\\nScotland and finish my work in solitude. I did not doubt but that the\\n\\nmonster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have\\n\\nfinished, that he might receive his companion.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of\\n\\nthe remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a place\\n\\nfitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were\\n\\ncontinually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely\\n\\naffording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its\\n\\ninhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs\\n\\ngave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they\\n\\nindulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from\\n\\nthe mainland, which was about five miles distant.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of\\n\\nthese was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained but two\\n\\nrooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable\\n\\npenury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the\\n\\ndoor was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some\\n\\nfurniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have\\n\\noccasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been\\n\\nbenumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at\\n\\nand unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes\\n\\nwhich I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations\\n\\nof men.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,\\n\\nwhen the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to\\n\\nlisten to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. It was a\\n\\nmonotonous yet ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was\\n\\nfar different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills\\n\\nare covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the\\n\\nplains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when\\n\\ntroubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively\\n\\ninfant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but\\n\\nas I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and\\n\\nirksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my\\n\\nlaboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night\\n\\nin order to complete my work. It was, indeed, a filthy process in\\n\\nwhich I was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind of\\n\\nenthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my\\n\\nmind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes\\n\\nwere shut to the horror of my proceedings. But now I went to it in\\n\\ncold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.\\n\\n\\n\\nThus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in\\n\\na solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from\\n\\nthe actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I\\n\\ngrew restless and nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my\\n\\npersecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing\\n\\nto raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much\\n\\ndreaded to behold. I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow\\n\\ncreatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably\\n\\nadvanced. I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager\\n\\nhope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was\\n\\nintermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken\\n\\nin my bosom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 20\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just\\n\\nrising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I\\n\\nremained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my\\n\\nlabour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention\\n\\nto it. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to\\n\\nconsider the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before, I was\\n\\nengaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled\\n\\nbarbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest\\n\\nremorse. I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was\\n\\nalike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her\\n\\nmate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had\\n\\nsworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she\\n\\nhad not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and\\n\\nreasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her\\n\\ncreation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived\\n\\nloathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence\\n\\nfor it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn\\n\\nwith disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him,\\n\\nand he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being\\n\\ndeserted by one of his own species.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world,\\n\\nyet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon\\n\\nthirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon\\n\\nthe earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a\\n\\ncondition precarious and full of terror. Had I right, for my own benefit,\\n\\nto inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had before been moved\\n\\nby the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by\\n\\nhis fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my\\n\\npromise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me\\n\\nas their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at\\n\\nthe price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.\\n\\n\\n\\nI trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by\\n\\nthe light of the moon the dæmon at the casement. A ghastly grin\\n\\nwrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task\\n\\nwhich he had allotted to me. Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he\\n\\nhad loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide\\n\\nand desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the\\n\\nfulfilment of my promise.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of\\n\\nmalice and treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my\\n\\npromise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion,\\n\\ntore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The wretch saw me\\n\\ndestroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for\\n\\nhappiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.\\n\\n\\n\\nI left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own\\n\\nheart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I\\n\\nsought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate\\n\\nthe gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most\\n\\nterrible reveries.\\n\\n\\n\\nSeveral hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea;\\n\\nit was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature\\n\\nreposed under the eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone\\n\\nspecked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound\\n\\nof voices as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the silence,\\n\\nalthough I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear\\n\\nwas suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a\\n\\nperson landed close to my house.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one\\n\\nendeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a\\n\\npresentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who\\n\\ndwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation\\n\\nof helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain\\n\\nendeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door\\n\\nopened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he\\n\\napproached me and said in a smothered voice,\\n\\n\\n\\n“You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you\\n\\nintend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery;\\n\\nI left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among\\n\\nits willow islands and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many\\n\\nmonths in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland. I have\\n\\nendured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my\\n\\nhopes?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like\\n\\nyourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself\\n\\nunworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe\\n\\nyourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of\\n\\nday will be hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am your master;\\n\\nobey!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is\\n\\narrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but\\n\\nthey confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in\\n\\nvice. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dæmon whose\\n\\ndelight is in death and wretchedness? Begone! I am firm, and your\\n\\nwords will only exasperate my rage.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the\\n\\nimpotence of anger. “Shall each man,” cried he, “find a\\n\\nwife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had\\n\\nfeelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.\\n\\nMan! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery,\\n\\nand soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for\\n\\never. Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my\\n\\nwretchedness? You can blast my other passions, but revenge\\n\\nremains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die, but\\n\\nfirst you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your\\n\\nmisery. Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful. I will watch with\\n\\nthe wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall\\n\\nrepent of the injuries you inflict.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.\\n\\nI have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend\\n\\nbeneath words. Leave me; I am inexorable.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your\\n\\nwedding-night.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI started forward and exclaimed, “Villain! Before you sign my\\n\\ndeath-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with\\n\\nprecipitation. In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot\\n\\nacross the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the\\n\\nwaves.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. I burned with rage to\\n\\npursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean. I\\n\\nwalked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination\\n\\nconjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I not\\n\\nfollowed him and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him\\n\\nto depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland. I shuddered\\n\\nto think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.\\n\\nAnd then I thought again of his words—“_I will be with you on\\n\\nyour wedding-night._” That, then, was the period fixed for the\\n\\nfulfilment of my destiny. In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and\\n\\nextinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I\\n\\nthought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she\\n\\nshould find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I\\n\\nhad shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall\\n\\nbefore my enemy without a bitter struggle.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became\\n\\ncalmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into\\n\\nthe depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last\\n\\nnight’s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I\\n\\nalmost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow\\n\\ncreatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. I\\n\\ndesired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true,\\n\\nbut uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to\\n\\nbe sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a\\n\\ndæmon whom I had myself created.\\n\\n\\n\\nI walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it\\n\\nloved and miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the\\n\\nsun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep\\n\\nsleep. I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves\\n\\nwere agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. The sleep\\n\\ninto which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as\\n\\nif I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to\\n\\nreflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the\\n\\nwords of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared\\n\\nlike a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my\\n\\nappetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a\\n\\nfishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;\\n\\nit contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to\\n\\njoin him. He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where\\n\\nhe was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired\\n\\nhis return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his\\n\\nIndian enterprise. He could not any longer delay his departure; but as\\n\\nhis journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now\\n\\nconjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of\\n\\nmy society on him as I could spare. He besought me, therefore, to\\n\\nleave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed\\n\\nsouthwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and\\n\\nI determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.\\n\\n\\n\\nYet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered\\n\\nto reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I\\n\\nmust enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must\\n\\nhandle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The next\\n\\nmorning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door\\n\\nof my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had\\n\\ndestroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had\\n\\nmangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself and\\n\\nthen entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments\\n\\nout of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my\\n\\nwork to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly\\n\\nput them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them\\n\\nup, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the\\n\\nmeantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my\\n\\nchemical apparatus.\\n\\n\\n\\nNothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place\\n\\nin my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon. I had\\n\\nbefore regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with\\n\\nwhatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film\\n\\nhad been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw\\n\\nclearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur\\n\\nto me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not\\n\\nreflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in\\n\\nmy own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made\\n\\nwould be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I\\n\\nbanished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different\\n\\nconclusion.\\n\\n\\n\\nBetween two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my\\n\\nbasket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.\\n\\nThe scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,\\n\\nbut I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a\\n\\ndreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my\\n\\nfellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was\\n\\nsuddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of\\n\\ndarkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound\\n\\nas it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, but\\n\\nthe air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then\\n\\nrising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations\\n\\nthat I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a\\n\\ndirect position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the\\n\\nmoon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its\\n\\nkeel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I\\n\\nslept soundly.\\n\\n\\n\\nI do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I\\n\\nfound that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and\\n\\nthe waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found\\n\\nthat the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from\\n\\nwhich I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found\\n\\nthat if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with\\n\\nwater. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I\\n\\nconfess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me\\n\\nand was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the\\n\\nworld that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the\\n\\nwide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in\\n\\nthe immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already\\n\\nbeen out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to\\n\\nmy other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds\\n\\nthat flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the\\n\\nsea; it was to be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your\\n\\ntask is already fulfilled!” I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and\\n\\nof Clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his\\n\\nsanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie so\\n\\ndespairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of\\n\\nclosing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the\\n\\nhorizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became\\n\\nfree from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick\\n\\nand hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high\\n\\nland towards the south.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlmost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured\\n\\nfor several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of\\n\\nwarm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have\\n\\nof life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a\\n\\npart of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a\\n\\nwild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived\\n\\nthe traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself\\n\\nsuddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. I\\n\\ncarefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at\\n\\nlength saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of\\n\\nextreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place\\n\\nwhere I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with\\n\\nme. As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good\\n\\nharbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected\\n\\nescape.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several\\n\\npeople crowded towards the spot. They seemed much surprised at my\\n\\nappearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered\\n\\ntogether with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me\\n\\na slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they\\n\\nspoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language. “My\\n\\ngood friends,” said I, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of\\n\\nthis town and inform me where I am?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice.\\n\\n“Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste,\\n\\nbut you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a\\n\\nstranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and\\n\\nangry countenances of his companions. “Why do you answer me so\\n\\nroughly?” I replied. “Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to\\n\\nreceive strangers so inhospitably.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the\\n\\nEnglish may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly\\n\\nincrease. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which\\n\\nannoyed and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn, but\\n\\nno one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the\\n\\ncrowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man\\n\\napproaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Come, sir, you must\\n\\nfollow me to Mr. Kirwin’s to give an account of yourself.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not\\n\\nthis a free country?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate,\\n\\nand you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was\\n\\nfound murdered here last night.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThis answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent;\\n\\nthat could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence\\n\\nand was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from\\n\\nfatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic\\n\\nto rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into\\n\\napprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that\\n\\nwas in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair\\n\\nall fear of ignominy or death.\\n\\n\\n\\nI must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of\\n\\nthe frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my\\n\\nrecollection.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 21\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old\\n\\nbenevolent man with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however,\\n\\nwith some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,\\n\\nhe asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the\\n\\nmagistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with\\n\\nhis son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o’clock,\\n\\nthey observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in\\n\\nfor port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did\\n\\nnot land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about\\n\\ntwo miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,\\n\\nand his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding\\n\\nalong the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his\\n\\nlength on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by the\\n\\nlight of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,\\n\\nwho was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the\\n\\ncorpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the\\n\\nwaves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even\\n\\nthat the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage\\n\\nof an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it\\n\\nto life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty\\n\\nyears of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of\\n\\nany violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but\\n\\nwhen the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of\\n\\nmy brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a\\n\\nmist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for\\n\\nsupport. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew\\n\\nan unfavourable augury from my manner.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe son confirmed his father’s account, but when Daniel Nugent was\\n\\ncalled he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he\\n\\nsaw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;\\n\\nand as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same\\n\\nboat in which I had just landed.\\n\\n\\n\\nA woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door\\n\\nof her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour\\n\\nbefore she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with\\n\\nonly one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse\\n\\nwas afterwards found.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the\\n\\nbody into her house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed and\\n\\nrubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was\\n\\nquite gone.\\n\\n\\n\\nSeveral other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed\\n\\nthat, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it\\n\\nwas very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been\\n\\nobliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.\\n\\nBesides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body\\n\\nfrom another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know\\n\\nthe shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance\\n\\nof the town of —— from the place where I had deposited the corpse.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into\\n\\nthe room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what\\n\\neffect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably\\n\\nsuggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the\\n\\nmurder had been described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate\\n\\nand several other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the\\n\\nstrange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,\\n\\nknowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had\\n\\ninhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly\\n\\ntranquil as to the consequences of the affair.\\n\\n\\n\\nI entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. How\\n\\ncan I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with\\n\\nhorror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and\\n\\nagony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,\\n\\npassed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry\\n\\nClerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on\\n\\nthe body, I exclaimed, “Have my murderous machinations deprived you\\n\\nalso, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other\\n\\nvictims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my\\n\\nbenefactor—”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and\\n\\nI was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.\\n\\n\\n\\nA fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; my\\n\\nravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the\\n\\nmurderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my\\n\\nattendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was\\n\\ntormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping\\n\\nmy neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke\\n\\nmy native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and\\n\\nbitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not\\n\\nsink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming\\n\\nchildren, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and\\n\\nyouthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the\\n\\nnext a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I\\n\\nmade that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of\\n\\nthe wheel, continually renewed the torture?\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from\\n\\na dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by\\n\\ngaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.\\n\\nIt was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had\\n\\nforgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some\\n\\ngreat misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around\\n\\nand saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I\\n\\nwas, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside\\n\\nme. She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her\\n\\ncountenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise\\n\\nthat class. The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of\\n\\npersons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her\\n\\ntone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English,\\n\\nand the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Are you better now, sir?” said she.\\n\\n\\n\\nI replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am;\\n\\nbut if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am\\n\\nstill alive to feel this misery and horror.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the\\n\\ngentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you\\n\\nwere dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, that’s none\\n\\nof my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty\\n\\nwith a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a\\n\\nspeech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt\\n\\nlanguid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series\\n\\nof my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it\\n\\nwere all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force\\n\\nof reality.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew\\n\\nfeverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed\\n\\nme with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. The\\n\\nphysician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared\\n\\nthem for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the\\n\\nexpression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the\\n\\nsecond. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the\\n\\nhangman who would gain his fee?\\n\\n\\n\\nThese were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had\\n\\nshown me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prison\\n\\nto be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who\\n\\nhad provided a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to\\n\\nsee me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of\\n\\nevery human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and\\n\\nmiserable ravings of a murderer. He came, therefore, sometimes to see\\n\\nthat I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long\\n\\nintervals.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes\\n\\nhalf open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom\\n\\nand misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to\\n\\nremain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I\\n\\nconsidered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the\\n\\npenalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my\\n\\nthoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.\\n\\nHis countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to\\n\\nmine and addressed me in French,\\n\\n\\n\\n“I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to\\n\\nmake you more comfortable?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole\\n\\nearth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to\\n\\none borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I\\n\\nhope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can\\n\\neasily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become\\n\\nthe most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and\\n\\nhave been, can death be any evil to me?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the\\n\\nstrange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some\\n\\nsurprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,\\n\\nseized immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was\\n\\npresented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so\\n\\nunaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across\\n\\nyour path.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on\\n\\nthis retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at\\n\\nthe knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose some\\n\\nastonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened\\n\\nto say,\\n\\n\\n\\n“Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on\\n\\nyour person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some\\n\\ntrace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune\\n\\nand illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which I\\n\\ndiscovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote\\n\\nto Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.\\n\\nBut you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any\\n\\nkind.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event;\\n\\ntell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am\\n\\nnow to lament?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Your family is perfectly well,” said Mr. Kirwin with\\n\\ngentleness; “and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it\\n\\ninstantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my\\n\\nmisery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for\\n\\nme to comply with his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes,\\n\\nand cried out in agony,\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not\\n\\nlet him enter!”\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help\\n\\nregarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in\\n\\nrather a severe tone,\\n\\n\\n\\n“I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father\\n\\nwould have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“My father!” cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed\\n\\nfrom anguish to pleasure. “Is my father indeed come? How kind, how\\n\\nvery kind! But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?”\\n\\n\\n\\nMy change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he\\n\\nthought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,\\n\\nand now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose and\\n\\nquitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.\\n\\n\\n\\nNothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the\\n\\narrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him and cried,\\n\\n\\n\\n“Are you then safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?”\\n\\n\\n\\nMy father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by\\n\\ndwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my\\n\\ndesponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of\\n\\ncheerfulness. “What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!”\\n\\nsaid he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance\\n\\nof the room. “You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems\\n\\nto pursue you. And poor Clerval—”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too\\n\\ngreat to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Alas! Yes, my father,” replied I; “some destiny of the\\n\\nmost horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I\\n\\nshould have died on the coffin of Henry.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWe were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the\\n\\nprecarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that\\n\\ncould ensure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my\\n\\nstrength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But the\\n\\nappearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I\\n\\ngradually recovered my health.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black\\n\\nmelancholy that nothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval was\\n\\nfor ever before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation\\n\\ninto which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous\\n\\nrelapse. Alas! Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a\\n\\nlife? It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now\\n\\ndrawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these\\n\\nthrobbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears\\n\\nme to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also\\n\\nsink to rest. Then the appearance of death was distant, although the\\n\\nwish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours\\n\\nmotionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that\\n\\nmight bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months\\n\\nin prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a\\n\\nrelapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country\\n\\ntown where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every\\n\\ncare of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence. I was spared\\n\\nthe disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not\\n\\nbrought before the court that decides on life and death. The grand\\n\\njury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney\\n\\nIslands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight\\n\\nafter my removal I was liberated from prison.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a\\n\\ncriminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh\\n\\natmosphere and permitted to return to my native country. I did not\\n\\nparticipate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a\\n\\npalace were alike hateful. The cup of life was poisoned for ever, and\\n\\nalthough the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I\\n\\nsaw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by\\n\\nno light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. Sometimes\\n\\nthey were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark\\n\\norbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed\\n\\nthem; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I\\n\\nfirst saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked\\n\\nof Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but\\n\\nthese words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a\\n\\nwish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved\\n\\ncousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more\\n\\nthe blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early\\n\\nchildhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a\\n\\nprison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and\\n\\nthese fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and\\n\\ndespair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the\\n\\nexistence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance\\n\\nto restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.\\n\\n\\n\\nYet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally\\n\\ntriumphed over my selfish despair. It was necessary that I should\\n\\nreturn without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those\\n\\nI so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any\\n\\nchance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to\\n\\nblast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to\\n\\nthe existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with the\\n\\nmockery of a soul still more monstrous. My father still desired to\\n\\ndelay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a\\n\\njourney, for I was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being. My\\n\\nstrength was gone. I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day\\n\\npreyed upon my wasted frame.\\n\\n\\n\\nStill, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience,\\n\\nmy father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vessel\\n\\nbound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.\\n\\nIt was midnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to\\n\\nthe dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my\\n\\nsight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should\\n\\nsoon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;\\n\\nyet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested\\n\\nshore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly\\n\\nthat I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest\\n\\ncompanion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I\\n\\nrepassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing\\n\\nwith my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for\\n\\nIngolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on\\n\\nto the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in\\n\\nwhich he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a\\n\\nthousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.\\n\\n\\n\\nEver since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of taking\\n\\nevery night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug\\n\\nonly that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of\\n\\nlife. Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now\\n\\nswallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did\\n\\nnot afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a\\n\\nthousand objects that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind\\n\\nof nightmare; I felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck and could not free\\n\\nmyself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. My father, who was\\n\\nwatching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves\\n\\nwere around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of\\n\\nsecurity, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour\\n\\nand the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm\\n\\nforgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly\\n\\nsusceptible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 22\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soon\\n\\nfound that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I\\n\\ncould continue my journey. My father’s care and attentions were\\n\\nindefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and\\n\\nsought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to\\n\\nseek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not\\n\\nabhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt\\n\\nattracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an\\n\\nangelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right\\n\\nto share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them whose\\n\\njoy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. How they\\n\\nwould, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know\\n\\nmy unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!\\n\\n\\n\\nMy father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by\\n\\nvarious arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he thought that I\\n\\nfelt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of\\n\\nmurder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Alas! My father,” said I, “how little do you know me. \\n\\nHuman beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such\\n\\na wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent\\n\\nas I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause\\n\\nof this—I murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry—they all\\n\\ndied by my hands.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMy father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same\\n\\nassertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an\\n\\nexplanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of\\n\\ndelirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented\\n\\nitself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my\\n\\nconvalescence. I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence\\n\\nconcerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion that I should be\\n\\nsupposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue. But,\\n\\nbesides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my\\n\\nhearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of\\n\\nhis breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was\\n\\nsilent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.\\n\\nYet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably\\n\\nfrom me. I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part\\n\\nrelieved the burden of my mysterious woe.\\n\\n\\n\\nUpon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder,\\n\\n“My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I entreat\\n\\nyou never to make such an assertion again.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who\\n\\nhave viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the\\n\\nassassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.\\n\\nA thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have\\n\\nsaved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not\\n\\nsacrifice the whole human race.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were\\n\\nderanged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and\\n\\nendeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. He wished as much as\\n\\npossible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in\\n\\nIreland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my\\n\\nmisfortunes.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my\\n\\nheart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own\\n\\ncrimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. By the utmost\\n\\nself-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which\\n\\nsometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners\\n\\nwere calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey\\n\\nto the sea of ice.\\n\\n\\n\\nA few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the\\n\\nfollowing letter from Elizabeth:\\n\\n\\n\\n“My dear Friend,\\n\\n\\n\\n“It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle\\n\\ndated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may\\n\\nhope to see you in less than a fortnight. My poor cousin, how much you\\n\\nmust have suffered! I expect to see you looking even more ill than\\n\\nwhen you quitted Geneva. This winter has been passed most miserably,\\n\\ntortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in\\n\\nyour countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of\\n\\ncomfort and tranquillity.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable\\n\\na year ago, even perhaps augmented by time. I would not disturb you at\\n\\nthis period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a\\n\\nconversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders\\n\\nsome explanation necessary before we meet.\\n\\n\\n\\nExplanation! You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain? If\\n\\nyou really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.\\n\\nBut you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet\\n\\nbe pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the\\n\\ncase, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I\\n\\nhave often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of\\n\\nyour parents ever since our infancy. We were told this when young, and\\n\\ntaught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take\\n\\nplace. We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I\\n\\nbelieve, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. But\\n\\nas brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each\\n\\nother without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our\\n\\ncase? Tell me, dearest Victor. Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual\\n\\nhappiness, with simple truth—Do you not love another?\\n\\n\\n\\n“You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at\\n\\nIngolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last\\n\\nautumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every\\n\\ncreature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our\\n\\nconnection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of\\n\\nyour parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations.\\n\\nBut this is false reasoning. I confess to you, my friend, that I love\\n\\nyou and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant\\n\\nfriend and companion. But it is your happiness I desire as well as my\\n\\nown when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally\\n\\nmiserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice. Even now\\n\\nI weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest\\n\\nmisfortunes, you may stifle, by the word _honour_, all hope of that\\n\\nlove and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. I, who\\n\\nhave so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries\\n\\ntenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes. Ah! Victor, be assured\\n\\nthat your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be\\n\\nmade miserable by this supposition. Be happy, my friend; and if you\\n\\nobey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth\\n\\nwill have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the\\n\\nnext day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain. My uncle\\n\\nwill send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your\\n\\nlips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I\\n\\nshall need no other happiness.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Elizabeth Lavenza.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Geneva, May 18th, 17—”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of\\n\\nthe fiend—“_I will be with you on your\\n\\nwedding-night!_” Such was my sentence, and on that night would the\\n\\ndæmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of\\n\\nhappiness which promised partly to console my sufferings. On that night he\\n\\nhad determined to consummate his crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a\\n\\ndeadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were\\n\\nvictorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. If he\\n\\nwere vanquished, I should be a free man. Alas! What freedom? Such as the\\n\\npeasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his\\n\\ncottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless,\\n\\npenniless, and alone, but free. Such would be my liberty except that in my\\n\\nElizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of\\n\\nremorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.\\n\\n\\n\\nSweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and reread her letter, and some\\n\\nsoftened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal\\n\\ndreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the\\n\\nangel’s arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make\\n\\nher happy. If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet,\\n\\nagain, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. My\\n\\ndestruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer\\n\\nshould suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would\\n\\nsurely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. He had vowed\\n\\n_to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider that\\n\\nthreat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that\\n\\nhe was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately\\n\\nafter the enunciation of his threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my\\n\\nimmediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my\\n\\nfather’s happiness, my adversary’s designs against my life\\n\\nshould not retard it a single hour.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and\\n\\naffectionate. “I fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “little happiness\\n\\nremains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in\\n\\nyou. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life\\n\\nand my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a\\n\\ndreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with\\n\\nhorror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only\\n\\nwonder that I survive what I have endured. I will confide this tale of\\n\\nmisery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place,\\n\\nfor, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us. But\\n\\nuntil then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it. This I most\\n\\nearnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIn about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s letter we returned\\n\\nto Geneva. The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were\\n\\nin her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a\\n\\nchange in her also. She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly\\n\\nvivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of\\n\\ncompassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I\\n\\nwas.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought madness\\n\\nwith it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed\\n\\nme; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and\\n\\ndespondent. I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless,\\n\\nbewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.\\n\\n\\n\\nElizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice\\n\\nwould soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human\\n\\nfeelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with me and for me. When reason\\n\\nreturned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with\\n\\nresignation. Ah! It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the\\n\\nguilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is\\n\\notherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.\\n\\n\\n\\nSoon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with\\n\\nElizabeth. I remained silent.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Have you, then, some other attachment?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“None on earth. I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with\\n\\ndelight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate\\n\\nmyself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallen\\n\\nus, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love\\n\\nfor those whom we have lost to those who yet live. Our circle will be\\n\\nsmall but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.\\n\\nAnd when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of\\n\\ncare will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly\\n\\ndeprived.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSuch were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of the\\n\\nthreat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had\\n\\nyet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as\\n\\ninvincible, and that when he had pronounced the words “_I shall be with\\n\\nyou on your wedding-night_,” I should regard the threatened fate as\\n\\nunavoidable. But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were\\n\\nbalanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful\\n\\ncountenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the\\n\\nceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined,\\n\\nthe seal to my fate.\\n\\n\\n\\nGreat God! If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish\\n\\nintention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself\\n\\nfor ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over\\n\\nthe earth than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if\\n\\npossessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real\\n\\nintentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I\\n\\nhastened that of a far dearer victim.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or\\n\\na prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my\\n\\nfeelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the\\n\\ncountenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer\\n\\neye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union with placid contentment,\\n\\nnot unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed,\\n\\nthat what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate\\n\\ninto an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.\\n\\n\\n\\nPreparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received,\\n\\nand all wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own\\n\\nheart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness\\n\\ninto the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the\\n\\ndecorations of my tragedy. Through my father’s exertions a part of\\n\\nthe inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian\\n\\ngovernment. A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her. It\\n\\nwas agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa\\n\\nLavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake\\n\\nnear which it stood.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the\\n\\nfiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger\\n\\nconstantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and\\n\\nby these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the\\n\\nperiod approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be\\n\\nregarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for\\n\\nin my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed\\n\\nfor its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of\\n\\nas an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.\\n\\n\\n\\nElizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to\\n\\ncalm her mind. But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my\\n\\ndestiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;\\n\\nand perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had\\n\\npromised to reveal to her on the following day. My father was in the\\n\\nmeantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in\\n\\nthe melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my\\n\\nfather’s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our\\n\\njourney by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our\\n\\nvoyage on the following day. The day was fair, the wind favourable;\\n\\nall smiled on our nuptial embarkation.\\n\\n\\n\\nThose were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the\\n\\nfeeling of happiness. We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we\\n\\nwere sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the\\n\\nbeauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw\\n\\nMont Salêve, the pleasant banks of Montalègre, and at a distance,\\n\\nsurmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy\\n\\nmountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the\\n\\nopposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the\\n\\nambition that would quit its native country, and an almost\\n\\ninsurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.\\n\\n\\n\\nI took the hand of Elizabeth. “You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! If\\n\\nyou knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would\\n\\nendeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this\\n\\none day at least permits me to enjoy.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; “there is, I hope,\\n\\nnothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not\\n\\npainted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to me\\n\\nnot to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I\\n\\nwill not listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move\\n\\nalong and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise\\n\\nabove the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more\\n\\ninteresting. Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in\\n\\nthe clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at\\n\\nthe bottom. What a divine day! How happy and serene all nature\\n\\nappears!”\\n\\n\\n\\nThus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all\\n\\nreflection upon melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating;\\n\\njoy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place\\n\\nto distraction and reverie.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and\\n\\nobserved its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the\\n\\nlower hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached\\n\\nthe amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. The\\n\\nspire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range\\n\\nof mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,\\n\\nsank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water\\n\\nand caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the\\n\\nshore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and\\n\\nhay. The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched\\n\\nthe shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp\\n\\nme and cling to me for ever.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 23\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was eight o’clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the\\n\\nshore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and\\n\\ncontemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured\\n\\nin darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence\\n\\nin the west. The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was\\n\\nbeginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the\\n\\nflight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the\\n\\nscene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves\\n\\nthat were beginning to rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.\\n\\n\\n\\nI had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the\\n\\nshapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious\\n\\nand watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in\\n\\nmy bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my\\n\\nlife dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that\\n\\nof my adversary was extinguished.\\n\\n\\n\\nElizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence,\\n\\nbut there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and\\n\\ntrembling, she asked, “What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?\\n\\nWhat is it you fear?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh! Peace, peace, my love,” replied I; “this night, and\\n\\nall will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how\\n\\nfearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife,\\n\\nand I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her\\n\\nuntil I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages\\n\\nof the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to\\n\\nmy adversary. But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to\\n\\nconjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the\\n\\nexecution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful\\n\\nscream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired. As I\\n\\nheard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the\\n\\nmotion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood\\n\\ntrickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This\\n\\nstate lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed\\n\\ninto the room.\\n\\n\\n\\nGreat God! Why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the\\n\\ndestruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? She was\\n\\nthere, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down\\n\\nand her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I\\n\\nturn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung\\n\\nby the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this and live? Alas!\\n\\nLife is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment\\n\\nonly did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their\\n\\ncountenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others\\n\\nappeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I\\n\\nescaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my\\n\\nwife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the\\n\\nposture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon\\n\\nher arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have\\n\\nsupposed her asleep. I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but\\n\\nthe deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held\\n\\nin my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.\\n\\nThe murderous mark of the fiend’s grasp was on her neck, and the\\n\\nbreath had ceased to issue from her lips.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.\\n\\nThe windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of\\n\\npanic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.\\n\\nThe shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be\\n\\ndescribed, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.\\n\\nA grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his\\n\\nfiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards\\n\\nthe window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me,\\n\\nleaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning,\\n\\nplunged into the lake.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to\\n\\nthe spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with\\n\\nboats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we\\n\\nreturned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a\\n\\nform conjured up by my fancy. After having landed, they proceeded to\\n\\nsearch the country, parties going in different directions among the\\n\\nwoods and vines.\\n\\n\\n\\nI attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the\\n\\nhouse, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken\\n\\nman, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my\\n\\neyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I\\n\\nwas carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had\\n\\nhappened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that\\n\\nI had lost.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room\\n\\nwhere the corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping around; I\\n\\nhung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no\\n\\ndistinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to\\n\\nvarious subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their\\n\\ncause. I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death\\n\\nof William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly\\n\\nof my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining\\n\\nfriends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now\\n\\nmight be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his\\n\\nfeet. This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action. I started\\n\\nup and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the\\n\\nwind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was\\n\\nhardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men\\n\\nto row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from\\n\\nmental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt,\\n\\nand the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any\\n\\nexertion. I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way\\n\\nto every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were\\n\\nfamiliar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day\\n\\nbefore in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.\\n\\nTears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw\\n\\nthe fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had\\n\\nthen been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as\\n\\na great and sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower,\\n\\nbut nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had\\n\\nsnatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been\\n\\nso miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of\\n\\nman.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last\\n\\noverwhelming event? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their\\n\\n_acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know\\n\\nthat, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My\\n\\nown strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of\\n\\nmy hideous narration.\\n\\n\\n\\nI arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk\\n\\nunder the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old\\n\\nman! His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their\\n\\ndelight—his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with\\n\\nall that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having\\n\\nfew affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed\\n\\nbe the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste\\n\\nin wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated\\n\\naround him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to\\n\\nrise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and\\n\\ndarkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes,\\n\\nindeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales\\n\\nwith the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a\\n\\ndungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear\\n\\nconception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my\\n\\nprison. For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I\\n\\nunderstood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.\\n\\n\\n\\nLiberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I\\n\\nawakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As the\\n\\nmemory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their\\n\\ncause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable dæmon whom I had\\n\\nsent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a\\n\\nmaddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed\\n\\nthat I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal\\n\\nrevenge on his cursed head.\\n\\n\\n\\nNor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to\\n\\nreflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about\\n\\na month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town\\n\\nand told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the\\n\\ndestroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole\\n\\nauthority for the apprehension of the murderer.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. “Be\\n\\nassured, sir,” said he, “no pains or exertions on my part shall\\n\\nbe spared to discover the villain.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I thank you,” replied I; “listen, therefore, to the\\n\\ndeposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that I\\n\\nshould fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth\\n\\nwhich, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to\\n\\nbe mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.” My\\n\\nmanner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my\\n\\nown heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose\\n\\nquieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related\\n\\nmy history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with\\n\\naccuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued\\n\\nhe became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with\\n\\nhorror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted\\n\\non his countenance.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I had concluded my narration, I said, “This is the being whom I\\n\\naccuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your\\n\\nwhole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that\\n\\nyour feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those\\n\\nfunctions on this occasion.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThis address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own\\n\\nauditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given\\n\\nto a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon\\n\\nto act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity\\n\\nreturned. He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly afford you\\n\\nevery aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to\\n\\nhave powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an\\n\\nanimal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where\\n\\nno man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since\\n\\nthe commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he\\n\\nhas wandered or what region he may now inhabit.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if\\n\\nhe has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois\\n\\nand destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do not\\n\\ncredit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the\\n\\npunishment which is his desert.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.\\n\\n“You are mistaken,” said he. “I will exert myself, and if\\n\\nit is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer\\n\\npunishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have\\n\\nyourself described to be his properties, that this will prove\\n\\nimpracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should\\n\\nmake up your mind to disappointment.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My\\n\\nrevenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I\\n\\nconfess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage\\n\\nis unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned\\n\\nloose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand; I have\\n\\nbut one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to\\n\\nhis destruction.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy\\n\\nin my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness\\n\\nwhich the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan\\n\\nmagistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of\\n\\ndevotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of\\n\\nmadness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and\\n\\nreverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of\\n\\nwisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on\\n\\nsome other mode of action.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 24\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was\\n\\nswallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone\\n\\nendowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and\\n\\nallowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise\\n\\ndelirium or death would have been my portion.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I\\n\\nwas happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became\\n\\nhateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels\\n\\nwhich had belonged to my mother, and departed.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. I have\\n\\ntraversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships\\n\\nwhich travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. How I\\n\\nhave lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon\\n\\nthe sandy plain and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared\\n\\nnot die and leave my adversary in being.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I\\n\\nmight trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled,\\n\\nand I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain\\n\\nwhat path I should pursue. As night approached I found myself at the\\n\\nentrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father\\n\\nreposed. I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their\\n\\ngraves. Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which\\n\\nwere gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the\\n\\nscene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested\\n\\nobserver. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to\\n\\ncast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the\\n\\nmourner.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to\\n\\nrage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived,\\n\\nand to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass\\n\\nand kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By the\\n\\nsacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the\\n\\ndeep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the\\n\\nspirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery,\\n\\nuntil he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I will\\n\\npreserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun\\n\\nand tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my\\n\\neyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering\\n\\nministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed\\n\\nand hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now\\n\\ntorments me.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me\\n\\nthat the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but\\n\\nthe furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish\\n\\nlaugh. It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed\\n\\nit, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.\\n\\nSurely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have\\n\\ndestroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I\\n\\nwas reserved for vengeance. The laughter died away, when a well-known\\n\\nand abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an\\n\\naudible whisper, “I am satisfied, miserable wretch! You have\\n\\ndetermined to live, and I am satisfied.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil\\n\\neluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone\\n\\nfull upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than\\n\\nmortal speed.\\n\\n\\n\\nI pursued him, and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a\\n\\nslight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly. The\\n\\nblue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend\\n\\nenter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I\\n\\ntook my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.\\n\\n\\n\\nAmidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I\\n\\nhave ever followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by\\n\\nthis horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,\\n\\nwho feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die,\\n\\nleft some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw\\n\\nthe print of his huge step on the white plain. To you first entering\\n\\non life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand\\n\\nwhat I have felt and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue were the\\n\\nleast pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil\\n\\nand carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good\\n\\nfollowed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly\\n\\nextricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes,\\n\\nwhen nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast\\n\\nwas prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. The\\n\\nfare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but\\n\\nI will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had\\n\\ninvoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and\\n\\nI was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the\\n\\nfew drops that revived me, and vanish.\\n\\n\\n\\nI followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dæmon\\n\\ngenerally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the\\n\\ncountry chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom\\n\\nseen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my\\n\\npath. I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers\\n\\nby distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed,\\n\\nwhich, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had\\n\\nprovided me with fire and utensils for cooking.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during\\n\\nsleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most\\n\\nmiserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The\\n\\nspirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of\\n\\nhappiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of\\n\\nthis respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was\\n\\nsustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my\\n\\nfriends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent\\n\\ncountenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’s\\n\\nvoice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by\\n\\na toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should\\n\\ncome and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest\\n\\nfriends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How did I cling to\\n\\ntheir dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and\\n\\npersuade myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that\\n\\nburned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the\\n\\ndestruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the\\n\\nmechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the\\n\\nardent desire of my soul.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he\\n\\nleft marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided\\n\\nme and instigated my fury. “My reign is not yet\\n\\nover”—these words were legible in one of these\\n\\ninscriptions—“you live, and my power is complete. Follow me; I\\n\\nseek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of\\n\\ncold and frost, to which I am impassive. You will find near this place, if\\n\\nyou follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. Come on, my\\n\\nenemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable\\n\\nhours must you endure until that period shall arrive.”\\n\\n\\n\\nScoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee,\\n\\nmiserable fiend, to torture and death. Never will I give up my search\\n\\nuntil he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my\\n\\nElizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the\\n\\nreward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the\\n\\ncold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants were\\n\\nshut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to\\n\\nseize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to\\n\\nseek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be\\n\\nprocured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One\\n\\ninscription that he left was in these words: “Prepare! Your toils\\n\\nonly begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter\\n\\nupon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting\\n\\nhatred.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMy courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I\\n\\nresolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support\\n\\nme, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,\\n\\nuntil the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary\\n\\nof the horizon. Oh! How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the\\n\\nsouth! Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by\\n\\nits superior wildness and ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when\\n\\nthey beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with\\n\\nrapture the boundary of their toils. I did not weep, but I knelt down\\n\\nand with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in\\n\\nsafety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary’s gibe,\\n\\nto meet and grapple with him.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus\\n\\ntraversed the snows with inconceivable speed. I know not whether the\\n\\nfiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had\\n\\ndaily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that\\n\\nwhen I first saw the ocean he was but one day’s journey in advance, and\\n\\nI hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach. With new\\n\\ncourage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched\\n\\nhamlet on the seashore. I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the\\n\\nfiend and gained accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said,\\n\\nhad arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols,\\n\\nputting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of\\n\\nhis terrific appearance. He had carried off their store of winter\\n\\nfood, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a\\n\\nnumerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same\\n\\nnight, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his\\n\\njourney across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they\\n\\nconjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the\\n\\nice or frozen by the eternal frosts.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.\\n\\nHe had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless\\n\\njourney across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few\\n\\nof the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a\\n\\ngenial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the idea\\n\\nthat the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance\\n\\nreturned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.\\n\\nAfter a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered\\n\\nround and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.\\n\\n\\n\\nI exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of\\n\\nthe Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I\\n\\ndeparted from land.\\n\\n\\n\\nI cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured\\n\\nmisery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution\\n\\nburning within my heart could have enabled me to support. Immense and\\n\\nrugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard\\n\\nthe thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction. But\\n\\nagain the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that\\n\\nI had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction\\n\\nof hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of\\n\\ndespondency and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured\\n\\nher prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery. Once, after\\n\\nthe poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the\\n\\nsummit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,\\n\\ndied, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye\\n\\ncaught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to\\n\\ndiscover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I\\n\\ndistinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known\\n\\nform within. Oh! With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!\\n\\nWarm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might\\n\\nnot intercept the view I had of the dæmon; but still my sight was\\n\\ndimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that\\n\\noppressed me, I wept aloud.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their\\n\\ndead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an\\n\\nhour’s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly\\n\\nirksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge was still visible, nor\\n\\ndid I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short\\n\\ntime some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeed\\n\\nperceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days’ journey, I\\n\\nbeheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within\\n\\nme.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were\\n\\nsuddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had\\n\\never done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as\\n\\nthe waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous\\n\\nand terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared;\\n\\nand, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a\\n\\ntremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a few\\n\\nminutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left\\n\\ndrifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and\\n\\nthus preparing for me a hideous death.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I\\n\\nmyself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your\\n\\nvessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.\\n\\nI had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded\\n\\nat the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and\\n\\nby these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in\\n\\nthe direction of your ship. I had determined, if you were going southwards,\\n\\nstill to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my\\n\\npurpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue\\n\\nmy enemy. But your direction was northwards. You took me on board when my\\n\\nvigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied\\n\\nhardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.\\n\\n\\n\\nOh! When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the dæmon, allow\\n\\nme the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live? If I do,\\n\\nswear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him\\n\\nand satisfy my vengeance in his death. And do I dare to ask of you to\\n\\nundertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?\\n\\nNo; I am not so selfish. Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if\\n\\nthe ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he\\n\\nshall not live—swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated\\n\\nwoes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes. He is eloquent\\n\\nand persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but\\n\\ntrust him not. His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery\\n\\nand fiend-like malice. Hear him not; call on the names of William,\\n\\nJustine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and\\n\\nthrust your sword into his heart. I will hover near and direct the\\n\\nsteel aright.\\n\\n\\n\\nWalton, _in continuation._\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAugust 26th, 17—.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not\\n\\nfeel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles\\n\\nmine? Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his\\n\\ntale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with\\n\\ndifficulty the words so replete with anguish. His fine and lovely eyes\\n\\nwere now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow\\n\\nand quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded his\\n\\ncountenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a\\n\\ntranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a\\n\\nvolcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression\\n\\nof the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth,\\n\\nyet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me,\\n\\nand the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a\\n\\ngreater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations,\\n\\nhowever earnest and connected. Such a monster has, then, really existence!\\n\\nI cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I\\n\\nendeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his\\n\\ncreature’s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Are you mad, my friend?” said he. “Or whither does your\\n\\nsenseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the\\n\\nworld a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries and do not seek\\n\\nto increase your own.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFrankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked\\n\\nto see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places,\\n\\nbut principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held\\n\\nwith his enemy. “Since you have preserved my narration,” said\\n\\nhe, “I would not that a mutilated one should go down to\\n\\nposterity.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest\\n\\ntale that ever imagination formed. My thoughts and every feeling of my\\n\\nsoul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale\\n\\nand his own elevated and gentle manners have created. I wish to soothe\\n\\nhim, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of\\n\\nevery hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! The only joy that he can\\n\\nnow know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and\\n\\ndeath. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and\\n\\ndelirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his\\n\\nfriends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or\\n\\nexcitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his\\n\\nfancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a\\n\\nremote world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render\\n\\nthem to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur conversations are not always confined to his own history and\\n\\nmisfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays\\n\\nunbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. His\\n\\neloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates\\n\\na pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love,\\n\\nwithout tears. What a glorious creature must he have been in the days\\n\\nof his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin! He seems\\n\\nto feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.\\n\\n\\n\\n“When younger,” said he, “I believed myself destined for\\n\\nsome great enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness\\n\\nof judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of\\n\\nthe worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed,\\n\\nfor I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that\\n\\nmight be useful to my fellow creatures. When I reflected on the work I had\\n\\ncompleted, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational\\n\\nanimal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But\\n\\nthis thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now\\n\\nserves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes\\n\\nare as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am\\n\\nchained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of\\n\\nanalysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I\\n\\nconceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot\\n\\nrecollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod\\n\\nheaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea\\n\\nof their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty\\n\\nambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once\\n\\nwas, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation. Despondency\\n\\nrarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell,\\n\\nnever, never again to rise.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMust I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have\\n\\nsought one who would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these desert\\n\\nseas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his\\n\\nvalue and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I thank you, Walton,” he said, “for your kind intentions towards so\\n\\nmiserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh\\n\\naffections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any\\n\\nman be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth? Even\\n\\nwhere the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence,\\n\\nthe companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our\\n\\nminds which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our\\n\\ninfantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified,\\n\\nare never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more\\n\\ncertain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a\\n\\nbrother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early,\\n\\nsuspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend,\\n\\nhowever strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be\\n\\ncontemplated with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only\\n\\nthrough habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever\\n\\nI am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of\\n\\nClerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one\\n\\nfeeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I\\n\\nwere engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive\\n\\nutility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. But\\n\\nsuch is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I\\n\\ngave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMy beloved Sister,\\n\\n\\n\\nSeptember 2d.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever\\n\\ndoomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit\\n\\nit. I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and\\n\\nthreaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows whom I\\n\\nhave persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have\\n\\nnone to bestow. There is something terribly appalling in our\\n\\nsituation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me. Yet it is\\n\\nterrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered\\n\\nthrough me. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my\\n\\ndestruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and\\n\\nyou will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! My\\n\\nbeloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is,\\n\\nin prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you have a husband\\n\\nand lovely children; you may be happy. Heaven bless you and make you so!\\n\\n\\n\\nMy unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. He\\n\\nendeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession\\n\\nwhich he valued. He reminds me how often the same accidents have\\n\\nhappened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite\\n\\nof myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel\\n\\nthe power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he\\n\\nrouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these\\n\\nvast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the\\n\\nresolutions of man. These feelings are transitory; each day of\\n\\nexpectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny\\n\\ncaused by this despair.\\n\\n\\n\\nSeptember 5th.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is\\n\\nhighly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot\\n\\nforbear recording it.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger\\n\\nof being crushed in their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of\\n\\nmy unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of\\n\\ndesolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire\\n\\nstill glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly\\n\\nroused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent\\n\\nlifelessness.\\n\\n\\n\\nI mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny.\\n\\nThis morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his\\n\\neyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly—I was roused by half\\n\\na dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin. They\\n\\nentered, and their leader addressed me. He told me that he and his\\n\\ncompanions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation\\n\\nto me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse.\\n\\nWe were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they\\n\\nfeared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free\\n\\npassage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and\\n\\nlead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted\\n\\nthis. They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn\\n\\npromise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my\\n\\ncourse southwards.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis speech troubled me. I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived\\n\\nthe idea of returning if set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even in\\n\\npossibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered, when\\n\\nFrankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly\\n\\nto have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled,\\n\\nand his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men,\\n\\nhe said,\\n\\n\\n\\n“What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you, then,\\n\\nso easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious\\n\\nexpedition? “And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was\\n\\nsmooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and\\n\\nterror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth\\n\\nand your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and\\n\\nthese you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this\\n\\nwas it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the\\n\\nbenefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men\\n\\nwho encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. And now,\\n\\nbehold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first\\n\\nmighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content\\n\\nto be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and\\n\\nperil; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm\\n\\nfiresides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come\\n\\nthus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove\\n\\nyourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your\\n\\npurposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your\\n\\nhearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it\\n\\nshall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace\\n\\nmarked on your brows. Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and\\n\\nwho know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed\\n\\nin his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can\\n\\nyou wonder that these men were moved? They looked at one another and were\\n\\nunable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had\\n\\nbeen said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously\\n\\ndesired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage\\n\\nwould return.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and\\n\\nalmost deprived of life.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than\\n\\nreturn shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be my\\n\\nfate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never\\n\\nwillingly continue to endure their present hardships.\\n\\n\\n\\nSeptember 7th.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed.\\n\\nThus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back\\n\\nignorant and disappointed. It requires more philosophy than I possess\\n\\nto bear this injustice with patience.\\n\\n\\n\\nSeptember 12th.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utility\\n\\nand glory; I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail these\\n\\nbitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted\\n\\ntowards England and towards you, I will not despond.\\n\\n\\n\\nSeptember 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard\\n\\nat a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction. We were\\n\\nin the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief\\n\\nattention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in\\n\\nsuch a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed. The ice cracked\\n\\nbehind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from\\n\\nthe west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly\\n\\nfree. When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native\\n\\ncountry was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them,\\n\\nloud and long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the\\n\\ncause of the tumult. “They shout,” I said, “because they\\n\\nwill soon return to England.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do you, then, really return?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Alas! Yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead them\\n\\nunwillingly to danger, and I must return.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your purpose, but\\n\\nmine is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not. I am weak, but\\n\\nsurely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with\\n\\nsufficient strength.” Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the\\n\\nbed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was\\n\\nentirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with\\n\\ndifficulty and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing\\n\\ndraught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the meantime he\\n\\ntold me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient. I sat\\n\\nby his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but\\n\\npresently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near,\\n\\nsaid, “Alas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall\\n\\nsoon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think\\n\\nnot, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning\\n\\nhatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself\\n\\njustified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I\\n\\nhave been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.\\n\\nIn a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was\\n\\nbound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and\\n\\nwell-being. This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to\\n\\nthat. My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to\\n\\nmy attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or\\n\\nmisery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to\\n\\ncreate a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity\\n\\nand selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction\\n\\nbeings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I\\n\\nknow where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may\\n\\nrender no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was\\n\\nmine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I\\n\\nasked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now,\\n\\nwhen I am only induced by reason and virtue.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil\\n\\nthis task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have\\n\\nlittle chance of meeting with him. But the consideration of these\\n\\npoints, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I\\n\\nleave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near\\n\\napproach of death. I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I\\n\\nmay still be misled by passion.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in\\n\\nother respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the\\n\\nonly happy one which I have enjoyed for several years. The forms of\\n\\nthe beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms. Farewell,\\n\\nWalton! Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it\\n\\nbe only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in\\n\\nscience and discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I have myself been\\n\\nblasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHis voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his\\n\\neffort, he sank into silence. About half an hour afterwards he\\n\\nattempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and\\n\\nhis eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed\\n\\naway from his lips.\\n\\n\\n\\nMargaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this\\n\\nglorious spirit? What can I say that will enable you to understand the\\n\\ndepth of my sorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate and\\n\\nfeeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of\\n\\ndisappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may there find\\n\\nconsolation.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the\\n\\nbreeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again there\\n\\nis a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin\\n\\nwhere the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise and examine.\\n\\nGood night, my sister.\\n\\n\\n\\nGreat God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the\\n\\nremembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail\\n\\nit; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this\\n\\nfinal and wonderful catastrophe.\\n\\n\\n\\nI entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable\\n\\nfriend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to\\n\\ndescribe—gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its\\n\\nproportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long\\n\\nlocks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and\\n\\napparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my\\n\\napproach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung\\n\\ntowards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of\\n\\nsuch loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily and\\n\\nendeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.\\n\\nI called on him to stay.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the\\n\\nlifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and\\n\\nevery feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some\\n\\nuncontrollable passion.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That is also my victim!” he exclaimed. “In his murder my\\n\\ncrimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its\\n\\nclose! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it\\n\\navail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee\\n\\nby destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he cannot answer\\n\\nme.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHis voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to\\n\\nme the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his\\n\\nenemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I\\n\\napproached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his\\n\\nface, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I\\n\\nattempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster\\n\\ncontinued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I\\n\\ngathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Your repentance,” I said, “is now superfluous. If you\\n\\nhad listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse\\n\\nbefore you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity,\\n\\nFrankenstein would yet have lived.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And do you dream?” said the dæmon. “Do you think that I was then\\n\\ndead to agony and remorse? He,” he continued, pointing to the corpse,\\n\\n“he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. Oh! Not the\\n\\nten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the\\n\\nlingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me\\n\\non, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think you that the\\n\\ngroans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart was fashioned to be\\n\\nsusceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice\\n\\nand hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without\\n\\ntorture such as you cannot even imagine.\\n\\n\\n\\n“After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken\\n\\nand overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I\\n\\nabhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of\\n\\nmy existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for\\n\\nhappiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me\\n\\nhe sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the\\n\\nindulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter\\n\\nindignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I\\n\\nrecollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished. I\\n\\nknew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the\\n\\nslave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not\\n\\ndisobey. Yet when she died! Nay, then I was not miserable. I had\\n\\ncast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my\\n\\ndespair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had no\\n\\nchoice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly\\n\\nchosen. The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable\\n\\npassion. And now it is ended; there is my last victim!”\\n\\n\\n\\nI was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called\\n\\nto mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and\\n\\npersuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my\\n\\nfriend, indignation was rekindled within me. “Wretch!” I said.\\n\\n“It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you\\n\\nhave made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are\\n\\nconsumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend!\\n\\nIf he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would\\n\\nhe become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you\\n\\nfeel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn\\n\\nfrom your power.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being.\\n\\n“Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to\\n\\nbe the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.\\n\\nNo sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of\\n\\nvirtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being\\n\\noverflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has\\n\\nbecome to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into\\n\\nbitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am\\n\\ncontent to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am\\n\\nwell satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once\\n\\nmy fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once\\n\\nI falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would\\n\\nlove me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was\\n\\nnourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has\\n\\ndegraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no\\n\\nmalignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the\\n\\nfrightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same\\n\\ncreature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent\\n\\nvisions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the\\n\\nfallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man\\n\\nhad friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my\\n\\ncrimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them\\n\\nhe could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured\\n\\nwasting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did\\n\\nnot satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still\\n\\nI desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no\\n\\ninjustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all\\n\\nhumankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his\\n\\nfriend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic\\n\\nwho sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous\\n\\nand immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an\\n\\nabortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my\\n\\nblood boils at the recollection of this injustice.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and\\n\\nthe helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to\\n\\ndeath his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have\\n\\ndevoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and\\n\\nadmiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that\\n\\nirremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but\\n\\nyour abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the\\n\\nhands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the\\n\\nimagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands\\n\\nwill meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work\\n\\nis nearly complete. Neither yours nor any man’s death is needed to\\n\\nconsummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done,\\n\\nbut it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this\\n\\nsacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me\\n\\nthither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall\\n\\ncollect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its\\n\\nremains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would\\n\\ncreate such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the\\n\\nagonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet\\n\\nunquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no\\n\\nmore, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no\\n\\nlonger see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light,\\n\\nfeeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my\\n\\nhappiness. Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first\\n\\nopened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the\\n\\nrustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to\\n\\nme, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by\\n\\ncrimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in\\n\\ndeath?\\n\\n\\n\\n“Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these\\n\\neyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive\\n\\nand yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better\\n\\nsatiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou\\n\\ndidst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness;\\n\\nand if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think\\n\\nand feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than\\n\\nthat which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to\\n\\nthine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my\\n\\nwounds until death shall close them for ever.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But soon,” he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, “I\\n\\nshall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burning\\n\\nmiseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and\\n\\nexult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration\\n\\nwill fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit\\n\\nwill sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.\\n\\nFarewell.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raft\\n\\nwhich lay close to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves and\\n\\nlost in darkness and distance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FRANKENSTEIN; OR, THE MODERN PROMETHEUS ', '\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Beasts of Tarzan\\n\\n\\n\\nby Edgar Rice Burroughs\\n\\n\\n\\nTo Joan Burroughs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContents\\n\\n\\n\\n CHAPTER I.

All they know, all that anyone knows, is that Nikolas\\n\\nRokoff has escaped.”\\n\\n\\n\\nJohn Clayton, Lord Greystoke—he who had been “Tarzan of the Apes”—sat\\n\\nin silence in the apartments of his friend, Lieutenant Paul D’Arnot, in\\n\\nParis, gazing meditatively at the toe of his immaculate boot.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis mind revolved many memories, recalled by the escape of his\\n\\narch-enemy from the French military prison to which he had been\\n\\nsentenced for life upon the testimony of the ape-man.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe thought of the lengths to which Rokoff had once gone to compass his\\n\\ndeath, and he realized that what the man had already done would\\n\\ndoubtless be as nothing by comparison with what he would wish and plot\\n\\nto do now that he was again free.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan had recently brought his wife and infant son to London to escape\\n\\nthe discomforts and dangers of the rainy season upon their vast estate\\n\\nin Uziri—the land of the savage Waziri warriors whose broad African\\n\\ndomains the ape-man had once ruled.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had run across the Channel for a brief visit with his old friend,\\n\\nbut the news of the Russian’s escape had already cast a shadow upon his\\n\\nouting, so that though he had but just arrived he was already\\n\\ncontemplating an immediate return to London.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is not that I fear for myself, Paul,” he said at last. “Many times\\n\\nin the past have I thwarted Rokoff’s designs upon my life; but now\\n\\nthere are others to consider. Unless I misjudge the man, he would more\\n\\nquickly strike at me through my wife or son than directly at me, for he\\n\\ndoubtless realizes that in no other way could he inflict greater\\n\\nanguish upon me. I must go back to them at once, and remain with them\\n\\nuntil Rokoff is recaptured—or dead.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAs these two talked in Paris, two other men were talking together in a\\n\\nlittle cottage upon the outskirts of London. Both were dark,\\n\\nsinister-looking men.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne was bearded, but the other, whose face wore the pallor of long\\n\\nconfinement within doors, had but a few days’ growth of black beard\\n\\nupon his face. It was he who was speaking.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You must needs shave off that beard of yours, Alexis,” he said to his\\n\\ncompanion. “With it he would recognize you on the instant. We must\\n\\nseparate here in the hour, and when we meet again upon the deck of the\\n\\nKincaid, let us hope that we shall have with us two honoured guests who\\n\\nlittle anticipate the pleasant voyage we have planned for them.\\n\\n\\n\\n“In two hours I should be upon my way to Dover with one of them, and by\\n\\ntomorrow night, if you follow my instructions carefully, you should\\n\\narrive with the other, provided, of course, that he returns to London\\n\\nas quickly as I presume he will.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There should be both profit and pleasure as well as other good things\\n\\nto reward our efforts, my dear Alexis. Thanks to the stupidity of the\\n\\nFrench, they have gone to such lengths to conceal the fact of my escape\\n\\nfor these many days that I have had ample opportunity to work out every\\n\\ndetail of our little adventure so carefully that there is little chance\\n\\nof the slightest hitch occurring to mar our prospects. And now\\n\\ngood-bye, and good luck!”\\n\\n\\n\\nThree hours later a messenger mounted the steps to the apartment of\\n\\nLieutenant D’Arnot.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A telegram for Lord Greystoke,” he said to the servant who answered\\n\\nhis summons. “Is he here?”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe man answered in the affirmative, and, signing for the message,\\n\\ncarried it within to Tarzan, who was already preparing to depart for\\n\\nLondon.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan tore open the envelope, and as he read his face went white.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Read it, Paul,” he said, handing the slip of paper to D’Arnot. “It has\\n\\ncome already.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Frenchman took the telegram and read:\\n\\n\\n\\n“Jack stolen from the garden through complicity of new servant. Come at\\n\\nonce.—JANE.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Tarzan leaped from the roadster that had met him at the station and\\n\\nran up the steps to his London town house he was met at the door by a\\n\\ndry-eyed but almost frantic woman.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuickly Jane Porter Clayton narrated all that she had been able to\\n\\nlearn of the theft of the boy.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe baby’s nurse had been wheeling him in the sunshine on the walk\\n\\nbefore the house when a closed taxicab drew up at the corner of the\\n\\nstreet. The woman had paid but passing attention to the vehicle, merely\\n\\nnoting that it discharged no passenger, but stood at the kerb with the\\n\\nmotor running as though waiting for a fare from the residence before\\n\\nwhich it had stopped.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlmost immediately the new houseman, Carl, had come running from the\\n\\nGreystoke house, saying that the girl’s mistress wished to speak with\\n\\nher for a moment, and that she was to leave little Jack in his care\\n\\nuntil she returned.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe woman said that she entertained not the slightest suspicion of the\\n\\nman’s motives until she had reached the doorway of the house, when it\\n\\noccurred to her to warn him not to turn the carriage so as to permit\\n\\nthe sun to shine in the baby’s eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs she turned about to call this to him she was somewhat surprised to\\n\\nsee that he was wheeling the carriage rapidly toward the corner, and at\\n\\nthe same time she saw the door of the taxicab open and a swarthy face\\n\\nframed for a moment in the aperture.\\n\\n\\n\\nIntuitively, the danger to the child flashed upon her, and with a\\n\\nshriek she dashed down the steps and up the walk toward the taxicab,\\n\\ninto which Carl was now handing the baby to the swarthy one within.\\n\\n\\n\\nJust before she reached the vehicle, Carl leaped in beside his\\n\\nconfederate, slamming the door behind him. At the same time the\\n\\nchauffeur attempted to start his machine, but it was evident that\\n\\nsomething had gone wrong, as though the gears refused to mesh, and the\\n\\ndelay caused by this, while he pushed the lever into reverse and backed\\n\\nthe car a few inches before again attempting to go ahead, gave the\\n\\nnurse time to reach the side of the taxicab.\\n\\n\\n\\nLeaping to the running-board, she had attempted to snatch the baby from\\n\\nthe arms of the stranger, and here, screaming and fighting, she had\\n\\nclung to her position even after the taxicab had got under way; nor was\\n\\nit until the machine had passed the Greystoke residence at good speed\\n\\nthat Carl, with a heavy blow to her face, had succeeded in knocking her\\n\\nto the pavement.\\n\\n\\n\\nHer screams had attracted servants and members of the families from\\n\\nresidences near by, as well as from the Greystoke home. Lady Greystoke\\n\\nhad witnessed the girl’s brave battle, and had herself tried to reach\\n\\nthe rapidly passing vehicle, but had been too late.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat was all that anyone knew, nor did Lady Greystoke dream of the\\n\\npossible identity of the man at the bottom of the plot until her\\n\\nhusband told her of the escape of Nikolas Rokoff from the French prison\\n\\nwhere they had hoped he was permanently confined.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Tarzan and his wife stood planning the wisest course to pursue, the\\n\\ntelephone bell rang in the library at their right. Tarzan quickly\\n\\nanswered the call in person.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Lord Greystoke?” asked a man’s voice at the other end of the line.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Your son has been stolen,” continued the voice, “and I alone may help\\n\\nyou to recover him. I am conversant with the plot of those who took\\n\\nhim. In fact, I was a party to it, and was to share in the reward, but\\n\\nnow they are trying to ditch me, and to be quits with them I will aid\\n\\nyou to recover him on condition that you will not prosecute me for my\\n\\npart in the crime. What do you say?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“If you lead me to where my son is hidden,” replied the ape-man, “you\\n\\nneed fear nothing from me.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Good,” replied the other. “But you must come alone to meet me, for it\\n\\nis enough that I must trust you. I cannot take the chance of permitting\\n\\nothers to learn my identity.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Where and when may I meet you?” asked Tarzan.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe other gave the name and location of a public-house on the\\n\\nwater-front at Dover—a place frequented by sailors.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come,” he concluded, “about ten o’clock tonight. It would do no good\\n\\nto arrive earlier. Your son will be safe enough in the meantime, and I\\n\\ncan then lead you secretly to where he is hidden. But be sure to come\\n\\nalone, and under no circumstances notify Scotland Yard, for I know you\\n\\nwell and shall be watching for you.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Should any other accompany you, or should I see suspicious characters\\n\\nwho might be agents of the police, I shall not meet you, and your last\\n\\nchance of recovering your son will be gone.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWithout more words the man rang off.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan repeated the gist of the conversation to his wife. She begged to\\n\\nbe allowed to accompany him, but he insisted that it might result in\\n\\nthe man’s carrying out his threat of refusing to aid them if Tarzan did\\n\\nnot come alone, and so they parted, he to hasten to Dover, and she,\\n\\nostensibly to wait at home until he should notify her of the outcome of\\n\\nhis mission.\\n\\n\\n\\nLittle did either dream of what both were destined to pass through\\n\\nbefore they should meet again, or the far-distant—but why anticipate?\\n\\n\\n\\nFor ten minutes after the ape-man had left her Jane Clayton walked\\n\\nrestlessly back and forth across the silken rugs of the library. Her\\n\\nmother heart ached, bereft of its first-born. Her mind was in an\\n\\nanguish of hopes and fears.\\n\\n\\n\\nThough her judgment told her that all would be well were her Tarzan to\\n\\ngo alone in accordance with the mysterious stranger’s summons, her\\n\\nintuition would not permit her to lay aside suspicion of the gravest\\n\\ndangers to both her husband and her son.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe more she thought of the matter, the more convinced she became that\\n\\nthe recent telephone message might be but a ruse to keep them inactive\\n\\nuntil the boy was safely hidden away or spirited out of England. Or it\\n\\nmight be that it had been simply a bait to lure Tarzan into the hands\\n\\nof the implacable Rokoff.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith the lodgment of this thought she stopped in wide-eyed terror.\\n\\nInstantly it became a conviction. She glanced at the great clock\\n\\nticking the minutes in the corner of the library.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was too late to catch the Dover train that Tarzan was to take. There\\n\\nwas another, later, however, that would bring her to the Channel port\\n\\nin time to reach the address the stranger had given her husband before\\n\\nthe appointed hour.\\n\\n\\n\\nSummoning her maid and chauffeur, she issued instructions rapidly. Ten\\n\\nminutes later she was being whisked through the crowded streets toward\\n\\nthe railway station.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was nine-forty-five that night that Tarzan entered the squalid “pub”\\n\\non the water-front in Dover. As he passed into the evil-smelling room a\\n\\nmuffled figure brushed past him toward the street.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come, my lord!” whispered the stranger.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ape-man wheeled about and followed the other into the ill-lit\\n\\nalley, which custom had dignified with the title of thoroughfare. Once\\n\\noutside, the fellow led the way into the darkness, nearer a wharf,\\n\\nwhere high-piled bales, boxes, and casks cast dense shadows. Here he\\n\\nhalted.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Where is the boy?” asked Greystoke.\\n\\n\\n\\n“On that small steamer whose lights you can just see yonder,” replied\\n\\nthe other.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the gloom Tarzan was trying to peer into the features of his\\n\\ncompanion, but he did not recognize the man as one whom he had ever\\n\\nbefore seen. Had he guessed that his guide was Alexis Paulvitch he\\n\\nwould have realized that naught but treachery lay in the man’s heart,\\n\\nand that danger lurked in the path of every move.\\n\\n\\n\\n“He is unguarded now,” continued the Russian. “Those who took him feel\\n\\nperfectly safe from detection, and with the exception of a couple of\\n\\nmembers of the crew, whom I have furnished with enough gin to silence\\n\\nthem effectually for hours, there is none aboard the Kincaid. We can go\\n\\naboard, get the child, and return without the slightest fear.”\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Let’s be about it, then,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis guide led him to a small boat moored alongside the wharf. The two\\n\\nmen entered, and Paulvitch pulled rapidly toward the steamer. The black\\n\\nsmoke issuing from her funnel did not at the time make any suggestion\\n\\nto Tarzan’s mind. All his thoughts were occupied with the hope that in\\n\\na few moments he would again have his little son in his arms.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the steamer’s side they found a monkey-ladder dangling close above\\n\\nthem, and up this the two men crept stealthily. Once on deck they\\n\\nhastened aft to where the Russian pointed to a hatch.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The boy is hidden there,” he said. “You had better go down after him,\\n\\nas there is less chance that he will cry in fright than should he find\\n\\nhimself in the arms of a stranger. I will stand on guard here.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSo anxious was Tarzan to rescue the child that he gave not the\\n\\nslightest thought to the strangeness of all the conditions surrounding\\n\\nthe Kincaid. That her deck was deserted, though she had steam up, and\\n\\nfrom the volume of smoke pouring from her funnel was all ready to get\\n\\nunder way made no impression upon him.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith the thought that in another instant he would fold that precious\\n\\nlittle bundle of humanity in his arms, the ape-man swung down into the\\n\\ndarkness below. Scarcely had he released his hold upon the edge of the\\n\\nhatch than the heavy covering fell clattering above him.\\n\\n\\n\\nInstantly he knew that he was the victim of a plot, and that far from\\n\\nrescuing his son he had himself fallen into the hands of his enemies.\\n\\nThough he immediately endeavoured to reach the hatch and lift the\\n\\ncover, he was unable to do so.\\n\\n\\n\\nStriking a match, he explored his surroundings, finding that a little\\n\\ncompartment had been partitioned off from the main hold, with the hatch\\n\\nabove his head the only means of ingress or egress. It was evident that\\n\\nthe room had been prepared for the very purpose of serving as a cell\\n\\nfor himself.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was nothing in the compartment, and no other occupant. If the\\n\\nchild was on board the Kincaid he was confined elsewhere.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor over twenty years, from infancy to manhood, the ape-man had roamed\\n\\nhis savage jungle haunts without human companionship of any nature. He\\n\\nhad learned at the most impressionable period of his life to take his\\n\\npleasures and his sorrows as the beasts take theirs.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo it was that he neither raved nor stormed against fate, but instead\\n\\nwaited patiently for what might next befall him, though not by any\\n\\nmeans without an eye to doing the utmost to succour himself. To this\\n\\nend he examined his prison carefully, tested the heavy planking that\\n\\nformed its walls, and measured the distance of the hatch above him.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd while he was thus occupied there came suddenly to him the vibration\\n\\nof machinery and the throbbing of the propeller.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ship was moving! Where to and to what fate was it carrying him?\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd even as these thoughts passed through his mind there came to his\\n\\nears above the din of the engines that which caused him to go cold with\\n\\napprehension.\\n\\n\\n\\nClear and shrill from the deck above him rang the scream of a\\n\\nfrightened woman.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\nMarooned\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Tarzan and his guide had disappeared into the shadows upon the dark\\n\\nwharf the figure of a heavily veiled woman had hurried down the narrow\\n\\nalley to the entrance of the drinking-place the two men had just\\n\\nquitted.\\n\\n\\n\\nHere she paused and looked about, and then as though satisfied that she\\n\\nhad at last reached the place she sought, she pushed bravely into the\\n\\ninterior of the vile den.\\n\\n\\n\\nA score of half-drunken sailors and wharf-rats looked up at the\\n\\nunaccustomed sight of a richly gowned woman in their midst. Rapidly she\\n\\napproached the slovenly barmaid who stared half in envy, half in hate,\\n\\nat her more fortunate sister.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Have you seen a tall, well-dressed man here, but a minute since,” she\\n\\nasked, “who met another and went away with him?”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe girl answered in the affirmative, but could not tell which way the\\n\\ntwo had gone. A sailor who had approached to listen to the conversation\\n\\nvouchsafed the information that a moment before as he had been about to\\n\\nenter the “pub” he had seen two men leaving it who walked toward the\\n\\nwharf.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Show me the direction they went,” cried the woman, slipping a coin\\n\\ninto the man’s hand.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fellow led her from the place, and together they walked quickly\\n\\ntoward the wharf and along it until across the water they saw a small\\n\\nboat just pulling into the shadows of a near-by steamer.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There they be,” whispered the man.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ten pounds if you will find a boat and row me to that steamer,” cried\\n\\nthe woman.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Quick, then,” he replied, “for we gotta go it if we’re goin’ to catch\\n\\nthe Kincaid afore she sails. She’s had steam up for three hours an’\\n\\njest been a-waitin’ fer that one passenger. I was a-talkin’ to one of\\n\\nher crew ’arf an hour ago.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he spoke he led the way to the end of the wharf where he knew\\n\\nanother boat lay moored, and, lowering the woman into it, he jumped in\\n\\nafter and pushed off. The two were soon scudding over the water.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the steamer’s side the man demanded his pay and, without waiting to\\n\\ncount out the exact amount, the woman thrust a handful of bank-notes\\n\\ninto his outstretched hand. A single glance at them convinced the\\n\\nfellow that he had been more than well paid. Then he assisted her up\\n\\nthe ladder, holding his skiff close to the ship’s side against the\\n\\nchance that this profitable passenger might wish to be taken ashore\\n\\nlater.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut presently the sound of the donkey engine and the rattle of a steel\\n\\ncable on the hoisting-drum proclaimed the fact that the Kincaid’s\\n\\nanchor was being raised, and a moment later the waiter heard the\\n\\npropellers revolving, and slowly the little steamer moved away from him\\n\\nout into the channel.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he turned to row back to shore he heard a woman’s shriek from the\\n\\nship’s deck.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s wot I calls rotten luck,” he soliloquized. “I might jest as\\n\\nwell of ’ad the whole bloomin’ wad.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Jane Clayton climbed to the deck of the Kincaid she found the ship\\n\\napparently deserted. There was no sign of those she sought nor of any\\n\\nother aboard, and so she went about her search for her husband and the\\n\\nchild she hoped against hope to find there without interruption.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuickly she hastened to the cabin, which was half above and half below\\n\\ndeck. As she hurried down the short companion-ladder into the main\\n\\ncabin, on either side of which were the smaller rooms occupied by the\\n\\nofficers, she failed to note the quick closing of one of the doors\\n\\nbefore her. She passed the full length of the main room, and then\\n\\nretracing her steps stopped before each door to listen, furtively\\n\\ntrying each latch.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll was silence, utter silence there, in which the throbbing of her own\\n\\nfrightened heart seemed to her overwrought imagination to fill the ship\\n\\nwith its thunderous alarm.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne by one the doors opened before her touch, only to reveal empty\\n\\ninteriors. In her absorption she did not note the sudden activity upon\\n\\nthe vessel, the purring of the engines, the throbbing of the propeller.\\n\\nShe had reached the last door upon the right now, and as she pushed it\\n\\nopen she was seized from within by a powerful, dark-visaged man, and\\n\\ndrawn hastily into the stuffy, ill-smelling interior.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sudden shock of fright which the unexpected attack had upon her\\n\\ndrew a single piercing scream from her throat; then the man clapped a\\n\\nhand roughly over the mouth.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not until we are farther from land, my dear,” he said. “Then you may\\n\\nyell your pretty head off.”\\n\\n\\n\\nLady Greystoke turned to look into the leering, bearded face so close\\n\\nto hers. The man relaxed the pressure of his fingers upon her lips, and\\n\\nwith a little moan of terror as she recognized him the girl shrank away\\n\\nfrom her captor.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nikolas Rokoff! M. Thuran!” she exclaimed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Your devoted admirer,” replied the Russian, with a low bow.\\n\\n\\n\\n“My little boy,” she said next, ignoring the terms of endearment—“where\\n\\nis he? Let me have him. How could you be so cruel—even as you—Nikolas\\n\\nRokoff—cannot be entirely devoid of mercy and compassion? Tell me where\\n\\nhe is. Is he aboard this ship? Oh, please, if such a thing as a heart\\n\\nbeats within your breast, take me to my baby!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“If you do as you are bid no harm will befall him,” replied Rokoff.\\n\\n“But remember that it is your own fault that you are here. You came\\n\\naboard voluntarily, and you may take the consequences. I little\\n\\nthought,” he added to himself, “that any such good luck as this would\\n\\ncome to me.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe went on deck then, locking the cabin-door upon his prisoner, and for\\n\\nseveral days she did not see him. The truth of the matter being that\\n\\nNikolas Rokoff was so poor a sailor that the heavy seas the Kincaid\\n\\nencountered from the very beginning of her voyage sent the Russian to\\n\\nhis berth with a bad attack of sea-sickness.\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring this time her only visitor was an uncouth Swede, the Kincaid’s\\n\\nunsavoury cook, who brought her meals to her. His name was Sven\\n\\nAnderssen, his one pride being that his patronymic was spelt with a\\n\\ndouble “s.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe man was tall and raw-boned, with a long yellow moustache, an\\n\\nunwholesome complexion, and filthy nails. The very sight of him with\\n\\none grimy thumb buried deep in the lukewarm stew, that seemed, from the\\n\\nfrequency of its repetition, to constitute the pride of his culinary\\n\\nart, was sufficient to take away the girl’s appetite.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis small, blue, close-set eyes never met hers squarely. There was a\\n\\nshiftiness of his whole appearance that even found expression in the\\n\\ncat-like manner of his gait, and to it all a sinister suggestion was\\n\\nadded by the long slim knife that always rested at his waist, slipped\\n\\nthrough the greasy cord that supported his soiled apron. Ostensibly it\\n\\nwas but an implement of his calling; but the girl could never free\\n\\nherself of the conviction that it would require less provocation to\\n\\nwitness it put to other and less harmless uses.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis manner toward her was surly, yet she never failed to meet him with\\n\\na pleasant smile and a word of thanks when he brought her food to her,\\n\\nthough more often than not she hurled the bulk of it through the tiny\\n\\ncabin port the moment that the door closed behind him.\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring the days of anguish that followed Jane Clayton’s imprisonment,\\n\\nbut two questions were uppermost in her mind—the whereabouts of her\\n\\nhusband and her son. She fully believed that the baby was aboard the\\n\\nKincaid, provided that he still lived, but whether Tarzan had been\\n\\npermitted to live after having been lured aboard the evil craft she\\n\\ncould not guess.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe knew, of course, the deep hatred that the Russian felt for the\\n\\nEnglishman, and she could think of but one reason for having him\\n\\nbrought aboard the ship—to dispatch him in comparative safety in\\n\\nrevenge for his having thwarted Rokoff’s pet schemes, and for having\\n\\nbeen at last the means of landing him in a French prison.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan, on his part, lay in the darkness of his cell, ignorant of the\\n\\nfact that his wife was a prisoner in the cabin almost above his head.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe same Swede that served Jane brought his meals to him, but, though\\n\\non several occasions Tarzan had tried to draw the man into\\n\\nconversation, he had been unsuccessful. He had hoped to learn through\\n\\nthis fellow whether his little son was aboard the Kincaid, but to every\\n\\nquestion upon this or kindred subjects the fellow returned but one\\n\\nreply, “Ay tank it blow purty soon purty hard.” So after several\\n\\nattempts Tarzan gave it up.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor weeks that seemed months to the two prisoners the little steamer\\n\\nforged on they knew not where. Once the Kincaid stopped to coal, only\\n\\nimmediately to take up the seemingly interminable voyage.\\n\\n\\n\\nRokoff had visited Jane Clayton but once since he had locked her in the\\n\\ntiny cabin. He had come gaunt and hollow-eyed from a long siege of\\n\\nsea-sickness. The object of his visit was to obtain from her her\\n\\npersonal cheque for a large sum in return for a guarantee of her\\n\\npersonal safety and return to England.\\n\\n\\n\\n“When you set me down safely in any civilized port, together with my\\n\\nson and my husband,” she replied, “I will pay you in gold twice the\\n\\namount you ask; but until then you shall not have a cent, nor the\\n\\npromise of a cent under any other conditions.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You will give me the cheque I ask,” he replied with a snarl, “or\\n\\nneither you nor your child nor your husband will ever again set foot\\n\\nwithin any port, civilized or otherwise.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I would not trust you,” she replied. “What guarantee have I that you\\n\\nwould not take my money and then do as you pleased with me and mine\\n\\nregardless of your promise?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I think you will do as I bid,” he said, turning to leave the cabin.\\n\\n“Remember that I have your son—if you chance to hear the agonized wail\\n\\nof a tortured child it may console you to reflect that it is because of\\n\\nyour stubbornness that the baby suffers—and that it is your baby.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You would not do it!” cried the girl. “You would not—could not be so\\n\\nfiendishly cruel!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is not I that am cruel, but you,” he returned, “for you permit a\\n\\npaltry sum of money to stand between your baby and immunity from\\n\\nsuffering.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe end of it was that Jane Clayton wrote out a cheque of large\\n\\ndenomination and handed it to Nikolas Rokoff, who left her cabin with a\\n\\ngrin of satisfaction upon his lips.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following day the hatch was removed from Tarzan’s cell, and as he\\n\\nlooked up he saw Paulvitch’s head framed in the square of light above\\n\\nhim.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come up,” commanded the Russian. “But bear in mind that you will be\\n\\nshot if you make a single move to attack me or any other aboard the\\n\\nship.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ape-man swung himself lightly to the deck. About him, but at a\\n\\nrespectful distance, stood a half-dozen sailors armed with rifles and\\n\\nrevolvers. Facing him was Paulvitch.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan looked about for Rokoff, who he felt sure must be aboard, but\\n\\nthere was no sign of him.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Lord Greystoke,” commenced the Russian, “by your continued and wanton\\n\\ninterference with M. Rokoff and his plans you have at last brought\\n\\nyourself and your family to this unfortunate extremity. You have only\\n\\nyourself to thank. As you may imagine, it has cost M. Rokoff a large\\n\\namount of money to finance this expedition, and, as you are the sole\\n\\ncause of it, he naturally looks to you for reimbursement.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Further, I may say that only by meeting M. Rokoff’s just demands may\\n\\nyou avert the most unpleasant consequences to your wife and child, and\\n\\nat the same time retain your own life and regain your liberty.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What is the amount?” asked Tarzan. “And what assurance have I that you\\n\\nwill live up to your end of the agreement? I have little reason to\\n\\ntrust two such scoundrels as you and Rokoff, you know.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Russian flushed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are in no position to deliver insults,” he said. “You have no\\n\\nassurance that we will live up to our agreement other than my word, but\\n\\nyou have before you the assurance that we can make short work of you if\\n\\nyou do not write out the cheque we demand.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Unless you are a greater fool than I imagine, you should know that\\n\\nthere is nothing that would give us greater pleasure than to order\\n\\nthese men to fire. That we do not is because we have other plans for\\n\\npunishing you that would be entirely upset by your death.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Answer one question,” said Tarzan. “Is my son on board this ship?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No,” replied Alexis Paulvitch, “your son is quite safe elsewhere; nor\\n\\nwill he be killed until you refuse to accede to our fair demands. If it\\n\\nbecomes necessary to kill you, there will be no reason for not killing\\n\\nthe child, since with you gone the one whom we wish to punish through\\n\\nthe boy will be gone, and he will then be to us only a constant source\\n\\nof danger and embarrassment. You see, therefore, that you may only save\\n\\nthe life of your son by saving your own, and you can only save your own\\n\\nby giving us the cheque we ask.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Very well,” replied Tarzan, for he knew that he could trust them to\\n\\ncarry out any sinister threat that Paulvitch had made, and there was a\\n\\nbare chance that by conceding their demands he might save the boy.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat they would permit him to live after he had appended his name to\\n\\nthe cheque never occurred to him as being within the realms of\\n\\nprobability. But he was determined to give them such a battle as they\\n\\nwould never forget, and possibly to take Paulvitch with him into\\n\\neternity. He was only sorry that it was not Rokoff.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe took his pocket cheque-book and fountain-pen from his pocket.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What is the amount?” he asked.\\n\\n\\n\\nPaulvitch named an enormous sum. Tarzan could scarce restrain a smile.\\n\\n\\n\\nTheir very cupidity was to prove the means of their undoing, in the\\n\\nmatter of the ransom at least. Purposely he hesitated and haggled over\\n\\nthe amount, but Paulvitch was obdurate. Finally the ape-man wrote out\\n\\nhis cheque for a larger sum than stood to his credit at the bank.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he turned to hand the worthless slip of paper to the Russian his\\n\\nglance chanced to pass across the starboard bow of the Kincaid. To his\\n\\nsurprise he saw that the ship lay within a few hundred yards of land.\\n\\nAlmost down to the water’s edge ran a dense tropical jungle, and behind\\n\\nwas higher land clothed in forest.\\n\\n\\n\\nPaulvitch noted the direction of his gaze.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are to be set at liberty here,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan’s plan for immediate physical revenge upon the Russian vanished.\\n\\nHe thought the land before him the mainland of Africa, and he knew that\\n\\nshould they liberate him here he could doubtless find his way to\\n\\ncivilization with comparative ease.\\n\\n\\n\\nPaulvitch took the cheque.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Remove your clothing,” he said to the ape-man. “Here you will not need\\n\\nit.”\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan demurred.\\n\\n\\n\\nPaulvitch pointed to the armed sailors. Then the Englishman slowly\\n\\ndivested himself of his clothing.\\n\\n\\n\\nA boat was lowered, and, still heavily guarded, the ape-man was rowed\\n\\nashore. Half an hour later the sailors had returned to the Kincaid, and\\n\\nthe steamer was slowly getting under way.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Tarzan stood upon the narrow strip of beach watching the departure\\n\\nof the vessel he saw a figure appear at the rail and call aloud to\\n\\nattract his attention.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ape-man had been about to read a note that one of the sailors had\\n\\nhanded him as the small boat that bore him to the shore was on the\\n\\npoint of returning to the steamer, but at the hail from the vessel’s\\n\\ndeck he looked up.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe saw a black-bearded man who laughed at him in derision as he held\\n\\nhigh above his head the figure of a little child. Tarzan half started\\n\\nas though to rush through the surf and strike out for the already\\n\\nmoving steamer; but realizing the futility of so rash an act he halted\\n\\nat the water’s edge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThus he stood, his gaze riveted upon the Kincaid until it disappeared\\n\\nbeyond a projecting promontory of the coast.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom the jungle at his back fierce bloodshot eyes glared from beneath\\n\\nshaggy overhanging brows upon him.\\n\\n\\n\\nLittle monkeys in the tree-tops chattered and scolded, and from the\\n\\ndistance of the inland forest came the scream of a leopard.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut still John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, stood deaf and unseeing,\\n\\nsuffering the pangs of keen regret for the opportunity that he had\\n\\nwasted because he had been so gullible as to place credence in a single\\n\\nstatement of the first lieutenant of his arch-enemy.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I have at least,” he thought, “one consolation—the knowledge that Jane\\n\\nis safe in London. Thank Heaven she, too, did not fall into the\\n\\nclutches of those villains.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBehind him the hairy thing whose evil eyes had been watching him as a\\n\\ncat watches a mouse was creeping stealthily toward him.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere were the trained senses of the savage ape-man?\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere the acute hearing?\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere the uncanny sense of scent?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\nBeasts at Bay\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSlowly Tarzan unfolded the note the sailor had thrust into his hand,\\n\\nand read it. At first it made little impression on his sorrow-numbed\\n\\nsenses, but finally the full purport of the hideous plot of revenge\\n\\nunfolded itself before his imagination.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This will explain to you” [the note read] “the exact nature of my\\n\\nintentions relative to your offspring and to you.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You were born an ape. You lived naked in the jungles—to your own we\\n\\nhave returned you; but your son shall rise a step above his sire. It is\\n\\nthe immutable law of evolution.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The father was a beast, but the son shall be a man—he shall take the\\n\\nnext ascending step in the scale of progress. He shall be no naked\\n\\nbeast of the jungle, but shall wear a loin-cloth and copper anklets,\\n\\nand, perchance, a ring in his nose, for he is to be reared by men—a\\n\\ntribe of savage cannibals.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I might have killed you, but that would have curtailed the full\\n\\nmeasure of the punishment you have earned at my hands.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Dead, you could not have suffered in the knowledge of your son’s\\n\\nplight; but living and in a place from which you may not escape to seek\\n\\nor succour your child, you shall suffer worse than death for all the\\n\\nyears of your life in contemplation of the horrors of your son’s\\n\\nexistence.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This, then, is to be a part of your punishment for having dared to pit\\n\\nyourself against\\n\\n\\n\\nN. R.\\n\\n\\n\\n“P.S.—The balance of your punishment has to do with what shall\\n\\npresently befall your wife—that I shall leave to your imagination.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he finished reading, a slight sound behind him brought him back with\\n\\na start to the world of present realities.\\n\\n\\n\\nInstantly his senses awoke, and he was again Tarzan of the Apes.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he wheeled about, it was a beast at bay, vibrant with the instinct\\n\\nof self-preservation, that faced a huge bull-ape that was already\\n\\ncharging down upon him.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe two years that had elapsed since Tarzan had come out of the savage\\n\\nforest with his rescued mate had witnessed slight diminution of the\\n\\nmighty powers that had made him the invincible lord of the jungle. His\\n\\ngreat estates in Uziri had claimed much of his time and attention, and\\n\\nthere he had found ample field for the practical use and retention of\\n\\nhis almost superhuman powers; but naked and unarmed to do battle with\\n\\nthe shaggy, bull-necked beast that now confronted him was a test that\\n\\nthe ape-man would scarce have welcomed at any period of his wild\\n\\nexistence.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut there was no alternative other than to meet the rage-maddened\\n\\ncreature with the weapons with which nature had endowed him.\\n\\n\\n\\nOver the bull’s shoulder Tarzan could see now the heads and shoulders\\n\\nof perhaps a dozen more of these mighty fore-runners of primitive man.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe knew, however, that there was little chance that they would attack\\n\\nhim, since it is not within the reasoning powers of the anthropoid to\\n\\nbe able to weigh or appreciate the value of concentrated action against\\n\\nan enemy—otherwise they would long since have become the dominant\\n\\ncreatures of their haunts, so tremendous a power of destruction lies in\\n\\ntheir mighty thews and savage fangs.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a low snarl the beast now hurled himself at Tarzan, but the\\n\\nape-man had found, among other things in the haunts of civilized man,\\n\\ncertain methods of scientific warfare that are unknown to the jungle\\n\\nfolk.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhereas, a few years since, he would have met the brute rush with brute\\n\\nforce, he now sidestepped his antagonist’s headlong charge, and as the\\n\\nbrute hurtled past him swung a mighty right to the pit of the ape’s\\n\\nstomach.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a howl of mingled rage and anguish the great anthropoid bent\\n\\ndouble and sank to the ground, though almost instantly he was again\\n\\nstruggling to his feet.\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore he could regain them, however, his white-skinned foe had wheeled\\n\\nand pounced upon him, and in the act there dropped from the shoulders\\n\\nof the English lord the last shred of his superficial mantle of\\n\\ncivilization.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce again he was the jungle beast revelling in bloody conflict with\\n\\nhis kind. Once again he was Tarzan, son of Kala the she-ape.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis strong, white teeth sank into the hairy throat of his enemy as he\\n\\nsought the pulsing jugular.\\n\\n\\n\\nPowerful fingers held the mighty fangs from his own flesh, or clenched\\n\\nand beat with the power of a steam-hammer upon the snarling,\\n\\nfoam-flecked face of his adversary.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a circle about them the balance of the tribe of apes stood watching\\n\\nand enjoying the struggle. They muttered low gutturals of approval as\\n\\nbits of white hide or hairy bloodstained skin were torn from one\\n\\ncontestant or the other. But they were silent in amazement and\\n\\nexpectation when they saw the mighty white ape wriggle upon the back of\\n\\ntheir king, and, with steel muscles tensed beneath the armpits of his\\n\\nantagonist, bear down mightily with his open palms upon the back of the\\n\\nthick bullneck, so that the king ape could but shriek in agony and\\n\\nflounder helplessly about upon the thick mat of jungle grass.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Tarzan had overcome the huge Terkoz that time years before when he\\n\\nhad been about to set out upon his quest for human beings of his own\\n\\nkind and colour, so now he overcame this other great ape with the same\\n\\nwrestling hold upon which he had stumbled by accident during that other\\n\\ncombat. The little audience of fierce anthropoids heard the creaking of\\n\\ntheir king’s neck mingling with his agonized shrieks and hideous\\n\\nroaring.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen there came a sudden crack, like the breaking of a stout limb\\n\\nbefore the fury of the wind. The bullet-head crumpled forward upon its\\n\\nflaccid neck against the great hairy chest—the roaring and the\\n\\nshrieking ceased.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe little pig-eyes of the onlookers wandered from the still form of\\n\\ntheir leader to that of the white ape that was rising to its feet\\n\\nbeside the vanquished, then back to their king as though in wonder that\\n\\nhe did not arise and slay this presumptuous stranger.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey saw the new-comer place a foot upon the neck of the quiet figure\\n\\nat his feet and, throwing back his head, give vent to the wild, uncanny\\n\\nchallenge of the bull-ape that has made a kill. Then they knew that\\n\\ntheir king was dead.\\n\\n\\n\\nAcross the jungle rolled the horrid notes of the victory cry. The\\n\\nlittle monkeys in the tree-tops ceased their chattering. The\\n\\nharsh-voiced, brilliant-plumed birds were still. From afar came the\\n\\nanswering wail of a leopard and the deep roar of a lion.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was the old Tarzan who turned questioning eyes upon the little knot\\n\\nof apes before him. It was the old Tarzan who shook his head as though\\n\\nto toss back a heavy mane that had fallen before his face—an old habit\\n\\ndating from the days that his great shock of thick, black hair had\\n\\nfallen about his shoulders, and often tumbled before his eyes when it\\n\\nhad meant life or death to him to have his vision unobstructed.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ape-man knew that he might expect an immediate attack on the part\\n\\nof that particular surviving bull-ape who felt himself best fitted to\\n\\ncontend for the kingship of the tribe. Among his own apes he knew that\\n\\nit was not unusual for an entire stranger to enter a community and,\\n\\nafter having dispatched the king, assume the leadership of the tribe\\n\\nhimself, together with the fallen monarch’s mates.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, if he made no attempt to follow them, they might\\n\\nmove slowly away from him, later to fight among themselves for the\\n\\nsupremacy. That he could be king of them, if he so chose, he was\\n\\nconfident; but he was not sure he cared to assume the sometimes irksome\\n\\nduties of that position, for he could see no particular advantage to be\\n\\ngained thereby.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the younger apes, a huge, splendidly muscled brute, was edging\\n\\nthreateningly closer to the ape-man. Through his bared fighting fangs\\n\\nthere issued a low, sullen growl.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan watched his every move, standing rigid as a statue. To have\\n\\nfallen back a step would have been to precipitate an immediate charge;\\n\\nto have rushed forward to meet the other might have had the same\\n\\nresult, or it might have put the bellicose one to flight—it all\\n\\ndepended upon the young bull’s stock of courage.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo stand perfectly still, waiting, was the middle course. In this event\\n\\nthe bull would, according to custom, approach quite close to the object\\n\\nof his attention, growling hideously and baring slavering fangs. Slowly\\n\\nhe would circle about the other, as though with a chip upon his\\n\\nshoulder; and this he did, even as Tarzan had foreseen.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt might be a bluff royal, or, on the other hand, so unstable is the\\n\\nmind of an ape, a passing impulse might hurl the hairy mass, tearing\\n\\nand rending, upon the man without an instant’s warning.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the brute circled him Tarzan turned slowly, keeping his eyes ever\\n\\nupon the eyes of his antagonist. He had appraised the young bull as one\\n\\nwho had never quite felt equal to the task of overthrowing his former\\n\\nking, but who one day would have done so. Tarzan saw that the beast was\\n\\nof wondrous proportions, standing over seven feet upon his short, bowed\\n\\nlegs.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis great, hairy arms reached almost to the ground even when he stood\\n\\nerect, and his fighting fangs, now quite close to Tarzan’s face, were\\n\\nexceptionally long and sharp. Like the others of his tribe, he differed\\n\\nin several minor essentials from the apes of Tarzan’s boyhood.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt first the ape-man had experienced a thrill of hope at sight of the\\n\\nshaggy bodies of the anthropoids—a hope that by some strange freak of\\n\\nfate he had been again returned to his own tribe; but a closer\\n\\ninspection had convinced him that these were another species.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the threatening bull continued his stiff and jerky circling of the\\n\\nape-man, much after the manner that you have noted among dogs when a\\n\\nstrange canine comes among them, it occurred to Tarzan to discover if\\n\\nthe language of his own tribe was identical with that of this other\\n\\nfamily, and so he addressed the brute in the language of the tribe of\\n\\nKerchak.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Who are you,” he asked, “who threatens Tarzan of the Apes?”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe hairy brute looked his surprise.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I am Akut,” replied the other in the same simple, primal tongue which\\n\\nis so low in the scale of spoken languages that, as Tarzan had\\n\\nsurmised, it was identical with that of the tribe in which the first\\n\\ntwenty years of his life had been spent.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I am Akut,” said the ape. “Molak is dead. I am king. Go away or I\\n\\nshall kill you!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You saw how easily I killed Molak,” replied Tarzan. “So I could kill\\n\\nyou if I cared to be king. But Tarzan of the Apes would not be king of\\n\\nthe tribe of Akut. All he wishes is to live in peace in this country.\\n\\nLet us be friends. Tarzan of the Apes can help you, and you can help\\n\\nTarzan of the Apes.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You cannot kill Akut,” replied the other. “None is so great as Akut.\\n\\nHad you not killed Molak, Akut would have done so, for Akut was ready\\n\\nto be king.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFor answer the ape-man hurled himself upon the great brute who during\\n\\nthe conversation had slightly relaxed his vigilance.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the twinkling of an eye the man had seized the wrist of the great\\n\\nape, and before the other could grapple with him had whirled him about\\n\\nand leaped upon his broad back.\\n\\n\\n\\nDown they went together, but so well had Tarzan’s plan worked out that\\n\\nbefore ever they touched the ground he had gained the same hold upon\\n\\nAkut that had broken Molak’s neck.\\n\\n\\n\\nSlowly he brought the pressure to bear, and then as in days gone by he\\n\\nhad given Kerchak the chance to surrender and live, so now he gave to\\n\\nAkut—in whom he saw a possible ally of great strength and resource—the\\n\\noption of living in amity with him or dying as he had just seen his\\n\\nsavage and heretofore invincible king die.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ka-Goda?” whispered Tarzan to the ape beneath him.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was the same question that he had whispered to Kerchak, and in the\\n\\nlanguage of the apes it means, broadly, “Do you surrender?”\\n\\n\\n\\nAkut thought of the creaking sound he had heard just before Molak’s\\n\\nthick neck had snapped, and he shuddered.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe hated to give up the kingship, though, so again he struggled to free\\n\\nhimself; but a sudden torturing pressure upon his vertebra brought an\\n\\nagonized “ka-goda!” from his lips.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan relaxed his grip a trifle.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You may still be king, Akut,” he said. “Tarzan told you that he did\\n\\nnot wish to be king. If any question your right, Tarzan of the Apes\\n\\nwill help you in your battles.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ape-man rose, and Akut came slowly to his feet. Shaking his bullet\\n\\nhead and growling angrily, he waddled toward his tribe, looking first\\n\\nat one and then at another of the larger bulls who might be expected to\\n\\nchallenge his leadership.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut none did so; instead, they drew away as he approached, and\\n\\npresently the whole pack moved off into the jungle, and Tarzan was left\\n\\nalone once more upon the beach.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ape-man was sore from the wounds that Molak had inflicted upon him,\\n\\nbut he was inured to physical suffering and endured it with the calm\\n\\nand fortitude of the wild beasts that had taught him to lead the jungle\\n\\nlife after the manner of all those that are born to it.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis first need, he realized, was for weapons of offence and defence,\\n\\nfor his encounter with the apes, and the distant notes of the savage\\n\\nvoices of Numa the lion, and Sheeta, the panther, warned him that his\\n\\nwas to be no life of indolent ease and security.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was but a return to the old existence of constant bloodshed and\\n\\ndanger—to the hunting and the being hunted. Grim beasts would stalk\\n\\nhim, as they had stalked him in the past, and never would there be a\\n\\nmoment, by savage day or by cruel night, that he might not have instant\\n\\nneed of such crude weapons as he could fashion from the materials at\\n\\nhand.\\n\\n\\n\\nUpon the shore he found an out-cropping of brittle, igneous rock. By\\n\\ndint of much labour he managed to chip off a narrow sliver some twelve\\n\\ninches long by a quarter of an inch thick. One edge was quite thin for\\n\\na few inches near the tip. It was the rudiment of a knife.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith it he went into the jungle, searching until he found a fallen tree\\n\\nof a certain species of hardwood with which he was familiar. From this\\n\\nhe cut a small straight branch, which he pointed at one end.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen he scooped a small, round hole in the surface of the prostrate\\n\\ntrunk. Into this he crumbled a few bits of dry bark, minutely shredded,\\n\\nafter which he inserted the tip of his pointed stick, and, sitting\\n\\nastride the bole of the tree, spun the slender rod rapidly between his\\n\\npalms.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter a time a thin smoke rose from the little mass of tinder, and a\\n\\nmoment later the whole broke into flame. Heaping some larger twigs and\\n\\nsticks upon the tiny fire, Tarzan soon had quite a respectable blaze\\n\\nroaring in the enlarging cavity of the dead tree.\\n\\n\\n\\nInto this he thrust the blade of his stone knife, and as it became\\n\\nsuperheated he would withdraw it, touching a spot near the thin edge\\n\\nwith a drop of moisture. Beneath the wetted area a little flake of the\\n\\nglassy material would crack and scale away.\\n\\n\\n\\nThus, very slowly, the ape-man commenced the tedious operation of\\n\\nputting a thin edge upon his primitive hunting-knife.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe did not attempt to accomplish the feat all in one sitting. At first\\n\\nhe was content to achieve a cutting edge of a couple of inches, with\\n\\nwhich he cut a long, pliable bow, a handle for his knife, a stout\\n\\ncudgel, and a goodly supply of arrows.\\n\\n\\n\\nThese he cached in a tall tree beside a little stream, and here also he\\n\\nconstructed a platform with a roof of palm-leaves above it.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen all these things had been finished it was growing dusk, and Tarzan\\n\\nfelt a strong desire to eat.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had noted during the brief incursion he had made into the forest\\n\\nthat a short distance up-stream from his tree there was a much-used\\n\\nwatering place, where, from the trampled mud of either bank, it was\\n\\nevident beasts of all sorts and in great numbers came to drink. To this\\n\\nspot the hungry ape-man made his silent way.\\n\\n\\n\\nThrough the upper terrace of the tree-tops he swung with the grace and\\n\\nease of a monkey. But for the heavy burden upon his heart he would have\\n\\nbeen happy in this return to the old free life of his boyhood.\\n\\n\\n\\nYet even with that burden he fell into the little habits and manners of\\n\\nhis early life that were in reality more a part of him than the thin\\n\\nveneer of civilization that the past three years of his association\\n\\nwith the white men of the outer world had spread lightly over him—a\\n\\nveneer that only hid the crudities of the beast that Tarzan of the Apes\\n\\nhad been.\\n\\n\\n\\nCould his fellow-peers of the House of Lords have seen him then they\\n\\nwould have held up their noble hands in holy horror.\\n\\n\\n\\nSilently he crouched in the lower branches of a great forest giant that\\n\\noverhung the trail, his keen eyes and sensitive ears strained into the\\n\\ndistant jungle, from which he knew his dinner would presently emerge.\\n\\n\\n\\nNor had he long to wait.\\n\\n\\n\\nScarce had he settled himself to a comfortable position, his lithe,\\n\\nmuscular legs drawn well up beneath him as the panther draws his\\n\\nhindquarters in preparation for the spring, than Bara, the deer, came\\n\\ndaintily down to drink.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut more than Bara was coming. Behind the graceful buck came another\\n\\nwhich the deer could neither see nor scent, but whose movements were\\n\\napparent to Tarzan of the Apes because of the elevated position of the\\n\\nape-man’s ambush.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe knew not yet exactly the nature of the thing that moved so\\n\\nstealthily through the jungle a few hundred yards behind the deer; but\\n\\nhe was convinced that it was some great beast of prey stalking Bara for\\n\\nthe selfsame purpose as that which prompted him to await the fleet\\n\\nanimal. Numa, perhaps, or Sheeta, the panther.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn any event, Tarzan could see his repast slipping from his grasp\\n\\nunless Bara moved more rapidly toward the ford than at present.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven as these thoughts passed through his mind some noise of the\\n\\nstalker in his rear must have come to the buck, for with a sudden start\\n\\nhe paused for an instant, trembling, in his tracks, and then with a\\n\\nswift bound dashed straight for the river and Tarzan. It was his\\n\\nintention to flee through the shallow ford and escape upon the opposite\\n\\nside of the river.\\n\\n\\n\\nNot a hundred yards behind him came Numa.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan could see him quite plainly now. Below the ape-man Bara was\\n\\nabout to pass. Could he do it? But even as he asked himself the\\n\\nquestion the hungry man launched himself from his perch full upon the\\n\\nback of the startled buck.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn another instant Numa would be upon them both, so if the ape-man were\\n\\nto dine that night, or ever again, he must act quickly.\\n\\n\\n\\nScarcely had he touched the sleek hide of the deer with a momentum that\\n\\nsent the animal to its knees than he had grasped a horn in either hand,\\n\\nand with a single quick wrench twisted the animal’s neck completely\\n\\nround, until he felt the vertebrae snap beneath his grip.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe lion was roaring in rage close behind him as he swung the deer\\n\\nacross his shoulder, and, grasping a foreleg between his strong teeth,\\n\\nleaped for the nearest of the lower branches that swung above his head.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith both hands he grasped the limb, and, at the instant that Numa\\n\\nsprang, drew himself and his prey out of reach of the animal’s cruel\\n\\ntalons.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a thud below him as the baffled cat fell back to earth, and\\n\\nthen Tarzan of the Apes, drawing his dinner farther up to the safety of\\n\\na higher limb, looked down with grinning face into the gleaming yellow\\n\\neyes of the other wild beast that glared up at him from beneath, and\\n\\nwith taunting insults flaunted the tender carcass of his kill in the\\n\\nface of him whom he had cheated of it.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith his crude stone knife he cut a juicy steak from the hindquarters,\\n\\nand while the great lion paced, growling, back and forth below him,\\n\\nLord Greystoke filled his savage belly, nor ever in the choicest of his\\n\\nexclusive London clubs had a meal tasted more palatable.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe warm blood of his kill smeared his hands and face and filled his\\n\\nnostrils with the scent that the savage carnivora love best.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd when he had finished he left the balance of the carcass in a high\\n\\nfork of the tree where he had dined, and with Numa trailing below him,\\n\\nstill keen for revenge, he made his way back to his tree-top shelter,\\n\\nwhere he slept until the sun was high the following morning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\nSheeta\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next few days were occupied by Tarzan in completing his weapons and\\n\\nexploring the jungle. He strung his bow with tendons from the buck upon\\n\\nwhich he had dined his first evening upon the new shore, and though he\\n\\nwould have preferred the gut of Sheeta for the purpose, he was content\\n\\nto wait until opportunity permitted him to kill one of the great cats.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe also braided a long grass rope—such a rope as he had used so many\\n\\nyears before to tantalize the ill-natured Tublat, and which later had\\n\\ndeveloped into a wondrous effective weapon in the practised hands of\\n\\nthe little ape-boy.\\n\\n\\n\\nA sheath and handle for his hunting-knife he fashioned, and a quiver\\n\\nfor arrows, and from the hide of Bara a belt and loin-cloth. Then he\\n\\nset out to learn something of the strange land in which he found\\n\\nhimself. That it was not his old familiar west coast of the African\\n\\ncontinent he knew from the fact that it faced east—the rising sun came\\n\\nup out of the sea before the threshold of the jungle.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut that it was not the east coast of Africa he was equally positive,\\n\\nfor he felt satisfied that the Kincaid had not passed through the\\n\\nMediterranean, the Suez Canal, and the Red Sea, nor had she had time to\\n\\nround the Cape of Good Hope. So he was quite at a loss to know where he\\n\\nmight be.\\n\\n\\n\\nSometimes he wondered if the ship had crossed the broad Atlantic to\\n\\ndeposit him upon some wild South American shore; but the presence of\\n\\nNuma, the lion, decided him that such could not be the case.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Tarzan made his lonely way through the jungle paralleling the shore,\\n\\nhe felt strong upon him a desire for companionship, so that gradually\\n\\nhe commenced to regret that he had not cast his lot with the apes. He\\n\\nhad seen nothing of them since that first day, when the influences of\\n\\ncivilization were still paramount within him.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow he was more nearly returned to the Tarzan of old, and though he\\n\\nappreciated the fact that there could be little in common between\\n\\nhimself and the great anthropoids, still they were better than no\\n\\ncompany at all.\\n\\n\\n\\nMoving leisurely, sometimes upon the ground and again among the lower\\n\\nbranches of the trees, gathering an occasional fruit or turning over a\\n\\nfallen log in search of the larger bugs, which he still found as\\n\\npalatable as of old, Tarzan had covered a mile or more when his\\n\\nattention was attracted by the scent of Sheeta up-wind ahead of him.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow Sheeta, the panther, was one whom Tarzan was exceptionally glad to\\n\\nfall in with, for he had it in mind not only to utilize the great cat’s\\n\\nstrong gut for his bow, but also to fashion a new quiver and loin-cloth\\n\\nfrom pieces of his hide. So, whereas the ape-man had gone carelessly\\n\\nbefore, he now became the personification of noiseless stealth.\\n\\n\\n\\nSwiftly and silently he glided through the forest in the wake of the\\n\\nsavage cat, nor was the pursuer, for all his noble birth, one whit less\\n\\nsavage than the wild, fierce thing he stalked.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he came closer to Sheeta he became aware that the panther on his\\n\\npart was stalking game of his own, and even as he realized this fact\\n\\nthere came to his nostrils, wafted from his right by a vagrant breeze,\\n\\nthe strong odour of a company of great apes.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe panther had taken to a large tree as Tarzan came within sight of\\n\\nhim, and beyond and below him Tarzan saw the tribe of Akut lolling in a\\n\\nlittle, natural clearing. Some of them were dozing against the boles of\\n\\ntrees, while others roamed about turning over bits of bark from beneath\\n\\nwhich they transferred the luscious grubs and beetles to their mouths.\\n\\n\\n\\nAkut was the closest to Sheeta.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe great cat lay crouched upon a thick limb, hidden from the ape’s\\n\\nview by dense foliage, waiting patiently until the anthropoid should\\n\\ncome within range of his spring.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan cautiously gained a position in the same tree with the panther\\n\\nand a little above him. In his left hand he grasped his slim stone\\n\\nblade. He would have preferred to use his noose, but the foliage\\n\\nsurrounding the huge cat precluded the possibility of an accurate throw\\n\\nwith the rope.\\n\\n\\n\\nAkut had now wandered quite close beneath the tree wherein lay the\\n\\nwaiting death. Sheeta slowly edged his hind paws along the branch still\\n\\nfurther beneath him, and then with a hideous shriek he launched himself\\n\\ntoward the great ape. The barest fraction of a second before his spring\\n\\nanother beast of prey above him leaped, its weird and savage cry\\n\\nmingling with his.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the startled Akut looked up he saw the panther almost above him, and\\n\\nalready upon the panther’s back the white ape that had bested him that\\n\\nday near the great water.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe teeth of the ape-man were buried in the back of Sheeta’s neck and\\n\\nhis right arm was round the fierce throat, while the left hand,\\n\\ngrasping a slender piece of stone, rose and fell in mighty blows upon\\n\\nthe panther’s side behind the left shoulder.\\n\\n\\n\\nAkut had just time to leap to one side to avoid being pinioned beneath\\n\\nthese battling monsters of the jungle.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a crash they came to earth at his feet. Sheeta was screaming,\\n\\nsnarling, and roaring horribly; but the white ape clung tenaciously and\\n\\nin silence to the thrashing body of his quarry.\\n\\n\\n\\nSteadily and remorselessly the stone knife was driven home through the\\n\\nglossy hide—time and again it drank deep, until with a final agonized\\n\\nlunge and shriek the great feline rolled over upon its side and, save\\n\\nfor the spasmodic jerking of its muscles, lay quiet and still in death.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the ape-man raised his head, as he stood over the carcass of his\\n\\nkill, and once again through the jungle rang his wild and savage\\n\\nvictory challenge.\\n\\n\\n\\nAkut and the apes of Akut stood looking in startled wonder at the dead\\n\\nbody of Sheeta and the lithe, straight figure of the man who had slain\\n\\nhim.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan was the first to speak.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had saved Akut’s life for a purpose, and, knowing the limitations of\\n\\nthe ape intellect, he also knew that he must make this purpose plain to\\n\\nthe anthropoid if it were to serve him in the way he hoped.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I am Tarzan of the Apes,” he said, “Mighty hunter. Mighty fighter. By\\n\\nthe great water I spared Akut’s life when I might have taken it and\\n\\nbecome king of the tribe of Akut. Now I have saved Akut from death\\n\\nbeneath the rending fangs of Sheeta.\\n\\n\\n\\n“When Akut or the tribe of Akut is in danger, let them call to Tarzan\\n\\nthus”—and the ape-man raised the hideous cry with which the tribe of\\n\\nKerchak had been wont to summon its absent members in times of peril.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And,” he continued, “when they hear Tarzan call to them, let them\\n\\nremember what he has done for Akut and come to him with great speed.\\n\\nShall it be as Tarzan says?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Huh!” assented Akut, and from the members of his tribe there rose a\\n\\nunanimous “Huh.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThen, presently, they went to feeding again as though nothing had\\n\\nhappened, and with them fed John Clayton, Lord Greystoke.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe noticed, however, that Akut kept always close to him, and was often\\n\\nlooking at him with a strange wonder in his little bloodshot eyes, and\\n\\nonce he did a thing that Tarzan during all his long years among the\\n\\napes had never before seen an ape do—he found a particularly tender\\n\\nmorsel and handed it to Tarzan.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the tribe hunted, the glistening body of the ape-man mingled with\\n\\nthe brown, shaggy hides of his companions. Oftentimes they brushed\\n\\ntogether in passing, but the apes had already taken his presence for\\n\\ngranted, so that he was as much one of them as Akut himself.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf he came too close to a she with a young baby, the former would bare\\n\\nher great fighting fangs and growl ominously, and occasionally a\\n\\ntruculent young bull would snarl a warning if Tarzan approached while\\n\\nthe former was eating. But in those things the treatment was no\\n\\ndifferent from that which they accorded any other member of the tribe.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan on his part felt very much at home with these fierce, hairy\\n\\nprogenitors of primitive man. He skipped nimbly out of reach of each\\n\\nthreatening female—for such is the way of apes, if they be not in one\\n\\nof their occasional fits of bestial rage—and he growled back at the\\n\\ntruculent young bulls, baring his canine teeth even as they. Thus\\n\\neasily he fell back into the way of his early life, nor did it seem\\n\\nthat he had ever tasted association with creatures of his own kind.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the better part of a week he roamed the jungle with his new\\n\\nfriends, partly because of a desire for companionship and partially\\n\\nthrough a well-laid plan to impress himself indelibly upon their\\n\\nmemories, which at best are none too long; for Tarzan from past\\n\\nexperience knew that it might serve him in good stead to have a tribe\\n\\nof these powerful and terrible beasts at his call.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen he was convinced that he had succeeded to some extent in fixing\\n\\nhis identity upon them he decided to again take up his exploration. To\\n\\nthis end he set out toward the north early one day, and, keeping\\n\\nparallel with the shore, travelled rapidly until almost nightfall.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the sun rose the next morning he saw that it lay almost directly\\n\\nto his right as he stood upon the beach instead of straight out across\\n\\nthe water as heretofore, and so he reasoned that the shore line had\\n\\ntrended toward the west. All the second day he continued his rapid\\n\\ncourse, and when Tarzan of the Apes sought speed, he passed through the\\n\\nmiddle terrace of the forest with the rapidity of a squirrel.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat night the sun set straight out across the water opposite the land,\\n\\nand then the ape-man guessed at last the truth that he had been\\n\\nsuspecting.\\n\\n\\n\\nRokoff had set him ashore upon an island.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe might have known it! If there was any plan that would render his\\n\\nposition more harrowing he should have known that such would be the one\\n\\nadopted by the Russian, and what could be more terrible than to leave\\n\\nhim to a lifetime of suspense upon an uninhabited island?\\n\\n\\n\\nRokoff doubtless had sailed directly to the mainland, where it would be\\n\\na comparatively easy thing for him to find the means of delivering the\\n\\ninfant Jack into the hands of the cruel and savage foster-parents, who,\\n\\nas his note had threatened, would have the upbringing of the child.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan shuddered as he thought of the cruel suffering the little one\\n\\nmust endure in such a life, even though he might fall into the hands of\\n\\nindividuals whose intentions toward him were of the kindest. The\\n\\nape-man had had sufficient experience with the lower savages of Africa\\n\\nto know that even there may be found the cruder virtues of charity and\\n\\nhumanity; but their lives were at best but a series of terrible\\n\\nprivations, dangers, and sufferings.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen there was the horrid after-fate that awaited the child as he grew\\n\\nto manhood. The horrible practices that would form a part of his\\n\\nlife-training would alone be sufficient to bar him forever from\\n\\nassociation with those of his own race and station in life.\\n\\n\\n\\nA cannibal! His little boy a savage man-eater! It was too horrible to\\n\\ncontemplate.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe filed teeth, the slit nose, the little face painted hideously.\\n\\nTarzan groaned. Could he but feel the throat of the Russ fiend beneath\\n\\nhis steel fingers!\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd Jane!\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat tortures of doubt and fear and uncertainty she must be suffering.\\n\\nHe felt that his position was infinitely less terrible than hers, for\\n\\nhe at least knew that one of his loved ones was safe at home, while she\\n\\nhad no idea of the whereabouts of either her husband or her son.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is well for Tarzan that he did not guess the truth, for the\\n\\nknowledge would have but added a hundredfold to his suffering.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he moved slowly through the jungle his mind absorbed by his gloomy\\n\\nthoughts, there presently came to his ears a strange scratching sound\\n\\nwhich he could not translate.\\n\\n\\n\\nCautiously he moved in the direction from which it emanated, presently\\n\\ncoming upon a huge panther pinned beneath a fallen tree.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Tarzan approached, the beast turned, snarling, toward him,\\n\\nstruggling to extricate itself; but one great limb across its back and\\n\\nthe smaller entangling branches pinioning its legs prevented it from\\n\\nmoving but a few inches in any direction.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ape-man stood before the helpless cat fitting an arrow to his bow\\n\\nthat he might dispatch the beast that otherwise must die of starvation;\\n\\nbut even as he drew back the shaft a sudden whim stayed his hand.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy rob the poor creature of life and liberty, when it would be so easy\\n\\na thing to restore both to it! He was sure from the fact that the\\n\\npanther moved all its limbs in its futile struggle for freedom that its\\n\\nspine was uninjured, and for the same reason he knew that none of its\\n\\nlimbs were broken.\\n\\n\\n\\nRelaxing his bowstring, he returned the arrow to the quiver and,\\n\\nthrowing the bow about his shoulder, stepped closer to the pinioned\\n\\nbeast.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn his lips was the soothing, purring sound that the great cats\\n\\nthemselves made when contented and happy. It was the nearest approach\\n\\nto a friendly advance that Tarzan could make in the language of Sheeta.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe panther ceased his snarling and eyed the ape-man closely. To lift\\n\\nthe tree’s great weight from the animal it was necessary to come within\\n\\nreach of those long, strong talons, and when the tree had been removed\\n\\nthe man would be totally at the mercy of the savage beast; but to\\n\\nTarzan of the Apes fear was a thing unknown.\\n\\n\\n\\nHaving decided, he acted promptly.\\n\\n\\n\\nUnhesitatingly, he stepped into the tangle of branches close to the\\n\\npanther’s side, still voicing his friendly and conciliatory purr. The\\n\\ncat turned his head toward the man, eyeing him steadily—questioningly.\\n\\nThe long fangs were bared, but more in preparedness than threat.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan put a broad shoulder beneath the bole of the tree, and as he did\\n\\nso his bare leg pressed against the cat’s silken side, so close was the\\n\\nman to the great beast.\\n\\n\\n\\nSlowly Tarzan extended his giant thews.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe great tree with its entangling branches rose gradually from the\\n\\npanther, who, feeling the encumbering weight diminish, quickly crawled\\n\\nfrom beneath. Tarzan let the tree fall back to earth, and the two\\n\\nbeasts turned to look upon one another.\\n\\n\\n\\nA grim smile lay upon the ape-man’s lips, for he knew that he had taken\\n\\nhis life in his hands to free this savage jungle fellow; nor would it\\n\\nhave surprised him had the cat sprung upon him the instant that it had\\n\\nbeen released.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it did not do so. Instead, it stood a few paces from the tree\\n\\nwatching the ape-man clamber out of the maze of fallen branches.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce outside, Tarzan was not three paces from the panther. He might\\n\\nhave taken to the higher branches of the trees upon the opposite side,\\n\\nfor Sheeta cannot climb to the heights to which the ape-man can go; but\\n\\nsomething, a spirit of bravado perhaps, prompted him to approach the\\n\\npanther as though to discover if any feeling of gratitude would prompt\\n\\nthe beast to friendliness.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he approached the mighty cat the creature stepped warily to one\\n\\nside, and the ape-man brushed past him within a foot of the dripping\\n\\njaws, and as he continued on through the forest the panther followed on\\n\\nbehind him, as a hound follows at heel.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a long time Tarzan could not tell whether the beast was following\\n\\nout of friendly feelings or merely stalking him against the time he\\n\\nshould be hungry; but finally he was forced to believe that the former\\n\\nincentive it was that prompted the animal’s action.\\n\\n\\n\\nLater in the day the scent of a deer sent Tarzan into the trees, and\\n\\nwhen he had dropped his noose about the animal’s neck he called to\\n\\nSheeta, using a purr similar to that which he had utilized to pacify\\n\\nthe brute’s suspicions earlier in the day, but a trifle louder and more\\n\\nshrill.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was similar to that which he had heard panthers use after a kill\\n\\nwhen they had been hunting in pairs.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlmost immediately there was a crashing of the underbrush close at\\n\\nhand, and the long, lithe body of his strange companion broke into\\n\\nview.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt sight of the body of Bara and the smell of blood the panther gave\\n\\nforth a shrill scream, and a moment later two beasts were feeding side\\n\\nby side upon the tender meat of the deer.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor several days this strangely assorted pair roamed the jungle\\n\\ntogether.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen one made a kill he called the other, and thus they fed well and\\n\\noften.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn one occasion as they were dining upon the carcass of a boar that\\n\\nSheeta had dispatched, Numa, the lion, grim and terrible, broke through\\n\\nthe tangled grasses close beside them.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith an angry, warning roar he sprang forward to chase them from their\\n\\nkill. Sheeta bounded into a near-by thicket, while Tarzan took to the\\n\\nlow branches of an overhanging tree.\\n\\n\\n\\nHere the ape-man unloosed his grass rope from about his neck, and as\\n\\nNuma stood above the body of the boar, challenging head erect, he\\n\\ndropped the sinuous noose about the maned neck, drawing the stout\\n\\nstrands taut with a sudden jerk. At the same time he called shrilly to\\n\\nSheeta, as he drew the struggling lion upward until only his hind feet\\n\\ntouched the ground.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuickly he made the rope fast to a stout branch, and as the panther, in\\n\\nanswer to his summons, leaped into sight, Tarzan dropped to the earth\\n\\nbeside the struggling and infuriated Numa, and with a long sharp knife\\n\\nsprang upon him at one side even as Sheeta did upon the other.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe panther tore and rent Numa upon the right, while the ape-man struck\\n\\nhome with his stone knife upon the other, so that before the mighty\\n\\nclawing of the king of beasts had succeeded in parting the rope he hung\\n\\nquite dead and harmless in the noose.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then upon the jungle air there rose in unison from two savage\\n\\nthroats the victory cry of the bull-ape and the panther, blended into\\n\\none frightful and uncanny scream.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the last notes died away in a long-drawn, fearsome wail, a score of\\n\\npainted warriors, drawing their long war-canoe upon the beach, halted\\n\\nto stare in the direction of the jungle and to listen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\nMugambi\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy the time that Tarzan had travelled entirely about the coast of the\\n\\nisland, and made several trips inland from various points, he was sure\\n\\nthat he was the only human being upon it.\\n\\n\\n\\nNowhere had he found any sign that men had stopped even temporarily\\n\\nupon this shore, though, of course, he knew that so quickly does the\\n\\nrank vegetation of the tropics erase all but the most permanent of\\n\\nhuman monuments that he might be in error in his deductions.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe day following the killing of Numa, Tarzan and Sheeta came upon the\\n\\ntribe of Akut. At sight of the panther the great apes took to flight,\\n\\nbut after a time Tarzan succeeded in recalling them.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt had occurred to him that it would be at least an interesting\\n\\nexperiment to attempt to reconcile these hereditary enemies. He\\n\\nwelcomed anything that would occupy his time and his mind beyond the\\n\\nfilling of his belly and the gloomy thoughts to which he fell prey the\\n\\nmoment that he became idle.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo communicate his plan to the apes was not a particularly difficult\\n\\nmatter, though their narrow and limited vocabulary was strained in the\\n\\neffort; but to impress upon the little, wicked brain of Sheeta that he\\n\\nwas to hunt with and not for his legitimate prey proved a task almost\\n\\nbeyond the powers of the ape-man.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan, among his other weapons, possessed a long, stout cudgel, and\\n\\nafter fastening his rope about the panther’s neck he used this\\n\\ninstrument freely upon the snarling beast, endeavouring in this way to\\n\\nimpress upon its memory that it must not attack the great, shaggy\\n\\nmanlike creatures that had approached more closely once they had seen\\n\\nthe purpose of the rope about Sheeta’s neck.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat the cat did not turn and rend Tarzan is something of a miracle\\n\\nwhich may possibly be accounted for by the fact that twice when it\\n\\nturned growling upon the ape-man he had rapped it sharply upon its\\n\\nsensitive nose, inculcating in its mind thereby a most wholesome fear\\n\\nof the cudgel and the ape-beasts behind it.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is a question if the original cause of his attachment for Tarzan was\\n\\nstill at all clear in the mind of the panther, though doubtless some\\n\\nsubconscious suggestion, superinduced by this primary reason and aided\\n\\nand abetted by the habit of the past few days, did much to compel the\\n\\nbeast to tolerate treatment at his hands that would have sent it at the\\n\\nthroat of any other creature.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen, too, there was the compelling force of the manmind exerting its\\n\\npowerful influence over this creature of a lower order, and, after all,\\n\\nit may have been this that proved the most potent factor in Tarzan’s\\n\\nsupremacy over Sheeta and the other beasts of the jungle that had from\\n\\ntime to time fallen under his domination.\\n\\n\\n\\nBe that as it may, for days the man, the panther, and the great apes\\n\\nroamed their savage haunts side by side, making their kills together\\n\\nand sharing them with one another, and of all the fierce and savage\\n\\nband none was more terrible than the smooth-skinned, powerful beast\\n\\nthat had been but a few short months before a familiar figure in many a\\n\\nLondon drawing room.\\n\\n\\n\\nSometimes the beasts separated to follow their own inclinations for an\\n\\nhour or a day, and it was upon one of these occasions when the ape-man\\n\\nhad wandered through the tree-tops toward the beach, and was stretched\\n\\nin the hot sun upon the sand, that from the low summit of a near-by\\n\\npromontory a pair of keen eyes discovered him.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a moment the owner of the eyes looked in astonishment at the figure\\n\\nof the savage white man basking in the rays of that hot, tropic sun;\\n\\nthen he turned, making a sign to some one behind him. Presently another\\n\\npair of eyes were looking down upon the ape-man, and then another and\\n\\nanother, until a full score of hideously trapped, savage warriors were\\n\\nlying upon their bellies along the crest of the ridge watching the\\n\\nwhite-skinned stranger.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey were down wind from Tarzan, and so their scent was not carried to\\n\\nhim, and as his back was turned half toward them he did not see their\\n\\ncautious advance over the edge of the promontory and down through the\\n\\nrank grass toward the sandy beach where he lay.\\n\\n\\n\\nBig fellows they were, all of them, their barbaric headdresses and\\n\\ngrotesquely painted faces, together with their many metal ornaments and\\n\\ngorgeously coloured feathers, adding to their wild, fierce appearance.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce at the foot of the ridge, they came cautiously to their feet, and,\\n\\nbent half-double, advanced silently upon the unconscious white man,\\n\\ntheir heavy war-clubs swinging menacingly in their brawny hands.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe mental suffering that Tarzan’s sorrowful thoughts induced had the\\n\\neffect of numbing his keen, perceptive faculties, so that the advancing\\n\\nsavages were almost upon him before he became aware that he was no\\n\\nlonger alone upon the beach.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo quickly, though, were his mind and muscles wont to react in unison\\n\\nto the slightest alarm that he was upon his feet and facing his\\n\\nenemies, even as he realized that something was behind him. As he\\n\\nsprang to his feet the warriors leaped toward him with raised clubs and\\n\\nsavage yells, but the foremost went down to sudden death beneath the\\n\\nlong, stout stick of the ape-man, and then the lithe, sinewy figure was\\n\\namong them, striking right and left with a fury, power, and precision\\n\\nthat brought panic to the ranks of the blacks.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a moment they withdrew, those that were left of them, and consulted\\n\\ntogether at a short distance from the ape-man, who stood with folded\\n\\narms, a half-smile upon his handsome face, watching them. Presently\\n\\nthey advanced upon him once more, this time wielding their heavy\\n\\nwar-spears. They were between Tarzan and the jungle, in a little\\n\\nsemicircle that closed in upon him as they advanced.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere seemed to the ape-man but slight chance to escape the final\\n\\ncharge when all the great spears should be hurled simultaneously at\\n\\nhim; but if he had desired to escape there was no way other than\\n\\nthrough the ranks of the savages except the open sea behind him.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis predicament was indeed most serious when an idea occurred to him\\n\\nthat altered his smile to a broad grin. The warriors were still some\\n\\nlittle distance away, advancing slowly, making, after the manner of\\n\\ntheir kind, a frightful din with their savage yells and the pounding of\\n\\ntheir naked feet upon the ground as they leaped up and down in a\\n\\nfantastic war dance.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen it was that the ape-man lifted his voice in a series of wild,\\n\\nweird screams that brought the blacks to a sudden, perplexed halt. They\\n\\nlooked at one another questioningly, for here was a sound so hideous\\n\\nthat their own frightful din faded into insignificance beside it. No\\n\\nhuman throat could have formed those bestial notes, they were sure, and\\n\\nyet with their own eyes they had seen this white man open his mouth to\\n\\npour forth his awful cry.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut only for a moment they hesitated, and then with one accord they\\n\\nagain took up their fantastic advance upon their prey; but even then a\\n\\nsudden crashing in the jungle behind them brought them once more to a\\n\\nhalt, and as they turned to look in the direction of this new noise\\n\\nthere broke upon their startled visions a sight that may well have\\n\\nfrozen the blood of braver men than the Wagambi.\\n\\n\\n\\nLeaping from the tangled vegetation of the jungle’s rim came a huge\\n\\npanther, with blazing eyes and bared fangs, and in his wake a score of\\n\\nmighty, shaggy apes lumbering rapidly toward them, half erect upon\\n\\ntheir short, bowed legs, and with their long arms reaching to the\\n\\nground, where their horny knuckles bore the weight of their ponderous\\n\\nbodies as they lurched from side to side in their grotesque advance.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe beasts of Tarzan had come in answer to his call.\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore the Wagambi could recover from their astonishment the frightful\\n\\nhorde was upon them from one side and Tarzan of the Apes from the\\n\\nother. Heavy spears were hurled and mighty war-clubs wielded, and\\n\\nthough apes went down never to rise, so, too, went down the men of\\n\\nUgambi.\\n\\n\\n\\nSheeta’s cruel fangs and tearing talons ripped and tore at the black\\n\\nhides. Akut’s mighty yellow tusks found the jugular of more than one\\n\\nsleek-skinned savage, and Tarzan of the Apes was here and there and\\n\\neverywhere, urging on his fierce allies and taking a heavy toll with\\n\\nhis long, slim knife.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a moment the blacks had scattered for their lives, but of the score\\n\\nthat had crept down the grassy sides of the promontory only a single\\n\\nwarrior managed to escape the horde that had overwhelmed his people.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis one was Mugambi, chief of the Wagambi of Ugambi, and as he\\n\\ndisappeared in the tangled luxuriousness of the rank growth upon the\\n\\nridge’s summit only the keen eyes of the ape-man saw the direction of\\n\\nhis flight.\\n\\n\\n\\nLeaving his pack to eat their fill upon the flesh of their\\n\\nvictims—flesh that he could not touch—Tarzan of the Apes pursued the\\n\\nsingle survivor of the bloody fray. Just beyond the ridge he came\\n\\nwithin sight of the fleeing black, making with headlong leaps for a\\n\\nlong war-canoe that was drawn well up upon the beach above the high\\n\\ntide surf.\\n\\n\\n\\nNoiseless as the fellow’s shadow, the ape-man raced after the\\n\\nterror-stricken black. In the white man’s mind was a new plan, awakened\\n\\nby sight of the war-canoe. If these men had come to his island from\\n\\nanother, or from the mainland, why not utilize their craft to make his\\n\\nway to the country from which they had come? Evidently it was an\\n\\ninhabited country, and no doubt had occasional intercourse with the\\n\\nmainland, if it were not itself upon the continent of Africa.\\n\\n\\n\\nA heavy hand fell upon the shoulder of the escaping Mugambi before he\\n\\nwas aware that he was being pursued, and as he turned to do battle with\\n\\nhis assailant giant fingers closed about his wrists and he was hurled\\n\\nto earth with a giant astride him before he could strike a blow in his\\n\\nown defence.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the language of the West Coast, Tarzan spoke to the prostrate man\\n\\nbeneath him.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Who are you?” he asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mugambi, chief of the Wagambi,” replied the black.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I will spare your life,” said Tarzan, “if you will promise to help me\\n\\nto leave this island. What do you answer?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I will help you,” replied Mugambi. “But now that you have killed all\\n\\nmy warriors, I do not know that even I can leave your country, for\\n\\nthere will be none to wield the paddles, and without paddlers we cannot\\n\\ncross the water.”\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan rose and allowed his prisoner to come to his feet. The fellow\\n\\nwas a magnificent specimen of manhood—a black counterpart in physique\\n\\nof the splendid white man whom he faced.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come!” said the ape-man, and started back in the direction from which\\n\\nthey could hear the snarling and growling of the feasting pack. Mugambi\\n\\ndrew back.\\n\\n\\n\\n“They will kill us,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I think not,” replied Tarzan. “They are mine.”\\n\\n\\n\\nStill the black hesitated, fearful of the consequences of approaching\\n\\nthe terrible creatures that were dining upon the bodies of his\\n\\nwarriors; but Tarzan forced him to accompany him, and presently the two\\n\\nemerged from the jungle in full view of the grisly spectacle upon the\\n\\nbeach. At sight of the men the beasts looked up with menacing growls,\\n\\nbut Tarzan strode in among them, dragging the trembling Wagambi with\\n\\nhim.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he had taught the apes to accept Sheeta, so he taught them to adopt\\n\\nMugambi as well, and much more easily; but Sheeta seemed quite unable\\n\\nto understand that though he had been called upon to devour Mugambi’s\\n\\nwarriors he was not to be allowed to proceed after the same fashion\\n\\nwith Mugambi. However, being well filled, he contented himself with\\n\\nwalking round the terror-stricken savage, emitting low, menacing growls\\n\\nthe while he kept his flaming, baleful eyes riveted upon the black.\\n\\n\\n\\nMugambi, on his part, clung closely to Tarzan, so that the ape-man\\n\\ncould scarce control his laughter at the pitiable condition to which\\n\\nthe chief’s fear had reduced him; but at length the white took the\\n\\ngreat cat by the scruff of the neck and, dragging it quite close to the\\n\\nWagambi, slapped it sharply upon the nose each time that it growled at\\n\\nthe stranger.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the sight of the thing—a man mauling with his bare hands one of the\\n\\nmost relentless and fierce of the jungle carnivora—Mugambi’s eyes\\n\\nbulged from their sockets, and from entertaining a sullen respect for\\n\\nthe giant white man who had made him prisoner, the black felt an almost\\n\\nworshipping awe of Tarzan.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe education of Sheeta progressed so well that in a short time Mugambi\\n\\nceased to be the object of his hungry attention, and the black felt a\\n\\ndegree more of safety in his society.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo say that Mugambi was entirely happy or at ease in his new\\n\\nenvironment would not be to adhere strictly to the truth. His eyes were\\n\\nconstantly rolling apprehensively from side to side as now one and now\\n\\nanother of the fierce pack chanced to wander near him, so that for the\\n\\nmost of the time it was principally the whites that showed.\\n\\n\\n\\nTogether Tarzan and Mugambi, with Sheeta and Akut, lay in wait at the\\n\\nford for a deer, and when at a word from the ape-man the four of them\\n\\nleaped out upon the affrighted animal the black was sure that the poor\\n\\ncreature died of fright before ever one of the great beasts touched it.\\n\\n\\n\\nMugambi built a fire and cooked his portion of the kill; but Tarzan,\\n\\nSheeta, and Akut tore theirs, raw, with their sharp teeth, growling\\n\\namong themselves when one ventured to encroach upon the share of\\n\\nanother.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was not, after all, strange that the white man’s ways should have\\n\\nbeen so much more nearly related to those of the beasts than were the\\n\\nsavage blacks. We are, all of us, creatures of habit, and when the\\n\\nseeming necessity for schooling ourselves in new ways ceases to exist,\\n\\nwe fall naturally and easily into the manners and customs which long\\n\\nusage has implanted ineradicably within us.\\n\\n\\n\\nMugambi from childhood had eaten no meat until it had been cooked,\\n\\nwhile Tarzan, on the other hand, had never tasted cooked food of any\\n\\nsort until he had grown almost to manhood, and only within the past\\n\\nthree or four years had he eaten cooked meat. Not only did the habit of\\n\\na lifetime prompt him to eat it raw, but the craving of his palate as\\n\\nwell; for to him cooked flesh was spoiled flesh when compared with the\\n\\nrich and juicy meat of a fresh, hot kill.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat he could, with relish, eat raw meat that had been buried by\\n\\nhimself weeks before, and enjoy small rodents and disgusting grubs,\\n\\nseems to us who have been always “civilized” a revolting fact; but had\\n\\nwe learned in childhood to eat these things, and had we seen all those\\n\\nabout us eat them, they would seem no more sickening to us now than do\\n\\nmany of our greatest dainties, at which a savage African cannibal would\\n\\nlook with repugnance and turn up his nose.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor instance, there is a tribe in the vicinity of Lake Rudolph that\\n\\nwill eat no sheep or cattle, though its next neighbors do so. Near by\\n\\nis another tribe that eats donkey-meat—a custom most revolting to the\\n\\nsurrounding tribes that do not eat donkey. So who may say that it is\\n\\nnice to eat snails and frogs’ legs and oysters, but disgusting to feed\\n\\nupon grubs and beetles, or that a raw oyster, hoof, horns, and tail, is\\n\\nless revolting than the sweet, clean meat of a fresh-killed buck?\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next few days Tarzan devoted to the weaving of a barkcloth sail\\n\\nwith which to equip the canoe, for he despaired of being able to teach\\n\\nthe apes to wield the paddles, though he did manage to get several of\\n\\nthem to embark in the frail craft which he and Mugambi paddled about\\n\\ninside the reef where the water was quite smooth.\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring these trips he had placed paddles in their hands, when they\\n\\nattempted to imitate the movements of him and Mugambi, but so difficult\\n\\nis it for them long to concentrate upon a thing that he soon saw that\\n\\nit would require weeks of patient training before they would be able to\\n\\nmake any effective use of these new implements, if, in fact, they\\n\\nshould ever do so.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was one exception, however, and he was Akut. Almost from the\\n\\nfirst he showed an interest in this new sport that revealed a much\\n\\nhigher plane of intelligence than that attained by any of his tribe. He\\n\\nseemed to grasp the purpose of the paddles, and when Tarzan saw that\\n\\nthis was so he took much pains to explain in the meagre language of the\\n\\nanthropoid how they might be used to the best advantage.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom Mugambi Tarzan learned that the mainland lay but a short distance\\n\\nfrom the island. It seemed that the Wagambi warriors had ventured too\\n\\nfar out in their frail craft, and when caught by a heavy tide and a\\n\\nhigh wind from off-shore they had been driven out of sight of land.\\n\\nAfter paddling for a whole night, thinking that they were headed for\\n\\nhome, they had seen this land at sunrise, and, still taking it for the\\n\\nmainland, had hailed it with joy, nor had Mugambi been aware that it\\n\\nwas an island until Tarzan had told him that this was the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Wagambi chief was quite dubious as to the sail, for he had never\\n\\nseen such a contrivance used. His country lay far up the broad Ugambi\\n\\nRiver, and this was the first occasion that any of his people had found\\n\\ntheir way to the ocean.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan, however, was confident that with a good west wind he could\\n\\nnavigate the little craft to the mainland. At any rate, he decided, it\\n\\nwould be preferable to perish on the way than to remain indefinitely\\n\\nupon this evidently uncharted island to which no ships might ever be\\n\\nexpected to come.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so it was that when the first fair wind rose he embarked upon his\\n\\ncruise, and with him he took as strange and fearsome a crew as ever\\n\\nsailed under a savage master.\\n\\n\\n\\nMugambi and Akut went with him, and Sheeta, the panther, and a dozen\\n\\ngreat males of the tribe of Akut.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\nA Hideous Crew\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe war-canoe with its savage load moved slowly toward the break in the\\n\\nreef through which it must pass to gain the open sea. Tarzan, Mugambi,\\n\\nand Akut wielded the paddles, for the shore kept the west wind from the\\n\\nlittle sail.\\n\\n\\n\\nSheeta crouched in the bow at the ape-man’s feet, for it had seemed\\n\\nbest to Tarzan always to keep the wicked beast as far from the other\\n\\nmembers of the party as possible, since it would require little or no\\n\\nprovocation to send him at the throat of any than the white man, whom\\n\\nhe evidently now looked upon as his master.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the stern was Mugambi, and just in front of him squatted Akut, while\\n\\nbetween Akut and Tarzan the twelve hairy apes sat upon their haunches,\\n\\nblinking dubiously this way and that, and now and then turning their\\n\\neyes longingly back toward shore.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll went well until the canoe had passed beyond the reef. Here the\\n\\nbreeze struck the sail, sending the rude craft lunging among the waves\\n\\nthat ran higher and higher as they drew away from the shore.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith the tossing of the boat the apes became panic-stricken. They first\\n\\nmoved uneasily about, and then commenced grumbling and whining. With\\n\\ndifficulty Akut kept them in hand for a time; but when a particularly\\n\\nlarge wave struck the dugout simultaneously with a little squall of\\n\\nwind their terror broke all bounds, and, leaping to their feet, they\\n\\nall but overturned the boat before Akut and Tarzan together could quiet\\n\\nthem. At last calm was restored, and eventually the apes became\\n\\naccustomed to the strange antics of their craft, after which no more\\n\\ntrouble was experienced with them.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe trip was uneventful, the wind held, and after ten hours’ steady\\n\\nsailing the black shadows of the coast loomed close before the\\n\\nstraining eyes of the ape-man in the bow. It was far too dark to\\n\\ndistinguish whether they had approached close to the mouth of the\\n\\nUgambi or not, so Tarzan ran in through the surf at the closest point\\n\\nto await the dawn.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe dugout turned broadside the instant that its nose touched the sand,\\n\\nand immediately it rolled over, with all its crew scrambling madly for\\n\\nthe shore. The next breaker rolled them over and over, but eventually\\n\\nthey all succeeded in crawling to safety, and in a moment more their\\n\\nungainly craft had been washed up beside them.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe balance of the night the apes sat huddled close to one another for\\n\\nwarmth; while Mugambi built a fire close to them over which he\\n\\ncrouched. Tarzan and Sheeta, however, were of a different mind, for\\n\\nneither of them feared the jungle night, and the insistent craving of\\n\\ntheir hunger sent them off into the Stygian blackness of the forest in\\n\\nsearch of prey.\\n\\n\\n\\nSide by side they walked when there was room for two abreast. At other\\n\\ntimes in single file, first one and then the other in advance. It was\\n\\nTarzan who first caught the scent of meat—a bull buffalo—and presently\\n\\nthe two came stealthily upon the sleeping beast in the midst of a dense\\n\\njungle of reeds close to a river.\\n\\n\\n\\nCloser and closer they crept toward the unsuspecting beast, Sheeta upon\\n\\nhis right side and Tarzan upon his left nearest the great heart. They\\n\\nhad hunted together now for some time, so that they worked in unison,\\n\\nwith only low, purring sounds as signals.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a moment they lay quite silent near their prey, and then at a sign\\n\\nfrom the ape-man Sheeta sprang upon the great back, burying his strong\\n\\nteeth in the bull’s neck. Instantly the brute sprang to his feet with a\\n\\nbellow of pain and rage, and at the same instant Tarzan rushed in upon\\n\\nhis left side with the stone knife, striking repeatedly behind the\\n\\nshoulder.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the ape-man’s hands clutched the thick mane, and as the bull\\n\\nraced madly through the reeds the thing striking at his life was\\n\\ndragged beside him. Sheeta but clung tenaciously to his hold upon the\\n\\nneck and back, biting deep in an effort to reach the spine.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor several hundred yards the bellowing bull carried his two savage\\n\\nantagonists, until at last the blade found his heart, when with a final\\n\\nbellow that was half-scream he plunged headlong to the earth. Then\\n\\nTarzan and Sheeta feasted to repletion.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter the meal the two curled up together in a thicket, the man’s black\\n\\nhead pillowed upon the tawny side of the panther. Shortly after dawn\\n\\nthey awoke and ate again, and then returned to the beach that Tarzan\\n\\nmight lead the balance of the pack to the kill.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the meal was done the brutes were for curling up to sleep, so\\n\\nTarzan and Mugambi set off in search of the Ugambi River. They had\\n\\nproceeded scarce a hundred yards when they came suddenly upon a broad\\n\\nstream, which the Negro instantly recognized as that down which he and\\n\\nhis warriors had paddled to the sea upon their ill-starred expedition.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe two now followed the stream down to the ocean, finding that it\\n\\nemptied into a bay not over a mile from the point upon the beach at\\n\\nwhich the canoe had been thrown the night before.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan was much elated by the discovery, as he knew that in the\\n\\nvicinity of a large watercourse he should find natives, and from some\\n\\nof these he had little doubt but that he should obtain news of Rokoff\\n\\nand the child, for he felt reasonably certain that the Russian would\\n\\nrid himself of the baby as quickly as possible after having disposed of\\n\\nTarzan.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe and Mugambi now righted and launched the dugout, though it was a\\n\\nmost difficult feat in the face of the surf which rolled continuously\\n\\nin upon the beach; but at last they were successful, and soon after\\n\\nwere paddling up the coast toward the mouth of the Ugambi. Here they\\n\\nexperienced considerable difficulty in making an entrance against the\\n\\ncombined current and ebb tide, but by taking advantage of eddies close\\n\\nin to shore they came about dusk to a point nearly opposite the spot\\n\\nwhere they had left the pack asleep.\\n\\n\\n\\nMaking the craft fast to an overhanging bough, the two made their way\\n\\ninto the jungle, presently coming upon some of the apes feeding upon\\n\\nfruit a little beyond the reeds where the buffalo had fallen. Sheeta\\n\\nwas not anywhere to be seen, nor did he return that night, so that\\n\\nTarzan came to believe that he had wandered away in search of his own\\n\\nkind.\\n\\n\\n\\nEarly the next morning the ape-man led his band down to the river, and\\n\\nas he walked he gave vent to a series of shrill cries. Presently from a\\n\\ngreat distance and faintly there came an answering scream, and a\\n\\nhalf-hour later the lithe form of Sheeta bounded into view where the\\n\\nothers of the pack were clambering gingerly into the canoe.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe great beast, with arched back and purring like a contented tabby,\\n\\nrubbed his sides against the ape-man, and then at a word from the\\n\\nlatter sprang lightly to his former place in the bow of the dugout.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen all were in place it was discovered that two of the apes of Akut\\n\\nwere missing, and though both the king ape and Tarzan called to them\\n\\nfor the better part of an hour, there was no response, and finally the\\n\\nboat put off without them. As it happened that the two missing ones\\n\\nwere the very same who had evinced the least desire to accompany the\\n\\nexpedition from the island, and had suffered the most from fright\\n\\nduring the voyage, Tarzan was quite sure that they had absented\\n\\nthemselves purposely rather than again enter the canoe.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the party were putting in for the shore shortly after noon to search\\n\\nfor food a slender, naked savage watched them for a moment from behind\\n\\nthe dense screen of verdure which lined the river’s bank, then he\\n\\nmelted away up-stream before any of those in the canoe discovered him.\\n\\n\\n\\nLike a deer he bounded along the narrow trail until, filled with the\\n\\nexcitement of his news, he burst into a native village several miles\\n\\nabove the point at which Tarzan and his pack had stopped to hunt.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Another white man is coming!” he cried to the chief who squatted\\n\\nbefore the entrance to his circular hut. “Another white man, and with\\n\\nhim are many warriors. They come in a great war-canoe to kill and rob\\n\\nas did the black-bearded one who has just left us.”\\n\\n\\n\\nKaviri leaped to his feet. He had but recently had a taste of the white\\n\\nman’s medicine, and his savage heart was filled with bitterness and\\n\\nhate. In another moment the rumble of the war-drums rose from the\\n\\nvillage, calling in the hunters from the forest and the tillers from\\n\\nthe fields.\\n\\n\\n\\nSeven war-canoes were launched and manned by paint-daubed, befeathered\\n\\nwarriors. Long spears bristled from the rude battle-ships, as they slid\\n\\nnoiselessly over the bosom of the water, propelled by giant muscles\\n\\nrolling beneath glistening, ebony hides.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was no beating of tom-toms now, nor blare of native horn, for\\n\\nKaviri was a crafty warrior, and it was in his mind to take no chances,\\n\\nif they could be avoided. He would swoop noiselessly down with his\\n\\nseven canoes upon the single one of the white man, and before the guns\\n\\nof the latter could inflict much damage upon his people he would have\\n\\noverwhelmed the enemy by force of numbers.\\n\\n\\n\\nKaviri’s own canoe went in advance of the others a short distance, and\\n\\nas it rounded a sharp bend in the river where the swift current bore it\\n\\nrapidly on its way it came suddenly upon the thing that Kaviri sought.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo close were the two canoes to one another that the black had only an\\n\\nopportunity to note the white face in the bow of the oncoming craft\\n\\nbefore the two touched and his own men were upon their feet, yelling\\n\\nlike mad devils and thrusting their long spears at the occupants of the\\n\\nother canoe.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut a moment later, when Kaviri was able to realize the nature of the\\n\\ncrew that manned the white man’s dugout, he would have given all the\\n\\nbeads and iron wire that he possessed to have been safely within his\\n\\ndistant village. Scarcely had the two craft come together than the\\n\\nfrightful apes of Akut rose, growling and barking, from the bottom of\\n\\nthe canoe, and, with long, hairy arms far outstretched, grasped the\\n\\nmenacing spears from the hands of Kaviri’s warriors.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe blacks were overcome with terror, but there was nothing to do other\\n\\nthan to fight. Now came the other war-canoes rapidly down upon the two\\n\\ncraft. Their occupants were eager to join the battle, for they thought\\n\\nthat their foes were white men and their native porters.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey swarmed about Tarzan’s craft; but when they saw the nature of the\\n\\nenemy all but one turned and paddled swiftly up-river. That one came\\n\\ntoo close to the ape-man’s craft before its occupants realized that\\n\\ntheir fellows were pitted against demons instead of men. As it touched\\n\\nTarzan spoke a few low words to Sheeta and Akut, so that before the\\n\\nattacking warriors could draw away there sprang upon them with a\\n\\nblood-freezing scream a huge panther, and into the other end of their\\n\\ncanoe clambered a great ape.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt one end the panther wrought fearful havoc with his mighty talons and\\n\\nlong, sharp fangs, while Akut at the other buried his yellow canines in\\n\\nthe necks of those that came within his reach, hurling the\\n\\nterror-stricken blacks overboard as he made his way toward the centre\\n\\nof the canoe.\\n\\n\\n\\nKaviri was so busily engaged with the demons that had entered his own\\n\\ncraft that he could offer no assistance to his warriors in the other. A\\n\\ngiant of a white devil had wrested his spear from him as though he, the\\n\\nmighty Kaviri, had been but a new-born babe. Hairy monsters were\\n\\novercoming his fighting men, and a black chieftain like himself was\\n\\nfighting shoulder to shoulder with the hideous pack that opposed him.\\n\\n\\n\\nKaviri battled bravely against his antagonist, for he felt that death\\n\\nhad already claimed him, and so the least that he could do would be to\\n\\nsell his life as dearly as possible; but it was soon evident that his\\n\\nbest was quite futile when pitted against the superhuman brawn and\\n\\nagility of the creature that at last found his throat and bent him back\\n\\ninto the bottom of the canoe.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently Kaviri’s head began to whirl—objects became confused and dim\\n\\nbefore his eyes—there was a great pain in his chest as he struggled for\\n\\nthe breath of life that the thing upon him was shutting off for ever.\\n\\nThen he lost consciousness.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen he opened his eyes once more he found, much to his surprise, that\\n\\nhe was not dead. He lay, securely bound, in the bottom of his own\\n\\ncanoe. A great panther sat upon its haunches, looking down upon him.\\n\\n\\n\\nKaviri shuddered and closed his eyes again, waiting for the ferocious\\n\\ncreature to spring upon him and put him out of his misery of terror.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter a moment, no rending fangs having buried themselves in his\\n\\ntrembling body, he again ventured to open his eyes. Beyond the panther\\n\\nkneeled the white giant who had overcome him.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe man was wielding a paddle, while directly behind him Kaviri saw\\n\\nsome of his own warriors similarly engaged. Back of them again squatted\\n\\nseveral of the hairy apes.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan, seeing that the chief had regained consciousness, addressed\\n\\nhim.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Your warriors tell me that you are the chief of a numerous people, and\\n\\nthat your name is Kaviri,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” replied the black.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why did you attack me? I came in peace.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Another white man ‘came in peace’ three moons ago,” replied Kaviri;\\n\\n“and after we had brought him presents of a goat and cassava and milk,\\n\\nhe set upon us with his guns and killed many of my people, and then\\n\\nwent on his way, taking all of our goats and many of our young men and\\n\\nwomen.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I am not as this other white man,” replied Tarzan. “I should not have\\n\\nharmed you had you not set upon me. Tell me, what was the face of this\\n\\nbad white man like? I am searching for one who has wronged me. Possibly\\n\\nthis may be the very one.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“He was a man with a bad face, covered with a great, black beard, and\\n\\nhe was very, very wicked—yes, very wicked indeed.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Was there a little white child with him?” asked Tarzan, his heart\\n\\nalmost stopped as he awaited the black’s answer.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, bwana,” replied Kaviri, “the white child was not with this man’s\\n\\nparty—it was with the other party.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Other party!” exclaimed Tarzan. “What other party?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“With the party that the very bad white man was pursuing. There was a\\n\\nwhite man, woman, and the child, with six Mosula porters. They passed\\n\\nup the river three days ahead of the very bad white man. I think that\\n\\nthey were running away from him.”\\n\\n\\n\\nA white man, woman, and child! Tarzan was puzzled. The child must be\\n\\nhis little Jack; but who could the woman be—and the man? Was it\\n\\npossible that one of Rokoff’s confederates had conspired with some\\n\\nwoman—who had accompanied the Russian—to steal the baby from him?\\n\\n\\n\\nIf this was the case, they had doubtless purposed returning the child\\n\\nto civilization and there either claiming a reward or holding the\\n\\nlittle prisoner for ransom.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut now that Rokoff had succeeded in chasing them far inland, up the\\n\\nsavage river, there could be little doubt but that he would eventually\\n\\noverhaul them, unless, as was still more probable, they should be\\n\\ncaptured and killed by the very cannibals farther up the Ugambi, to\\n\\nwhom, Tarzan was now convinced, it had been Rokoff’s intention to\\n\\ndeliver the baby.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he talked to Kaviri the canoes had been moving steadily up-river\\n\\ntoward the chief’s village. Kaviri’s warriors plied the paddles in the\\n\\nthree canoes, casting sidelong, terrified glances at their hideous\\n\\npassengers. Three of the apes of Akut had been killed in the encounter,\\n\\nbut there were, with Akut, eight of the frightful beasts remaining, and\\n\\nthere was Sheeta, the panther, and Tarzan and Mugambi.\\n\\n\\n\\nKaviri’s warriors thought that they had never seen so terrible a crew\\n\\nin all their lives. Momentarily they expected to be pounced upon and\\n\\ntorn asunder by some of their captors; and, in fact, it was all that\\n\\nTarzan and Mugambi and Akut could do to keep the snarling, ill-natured\\n\\nbrutes from snapping at the glistening, naked bodies that brushed\\n\\nagainst them now and then with the movements of the paddlers, whose\\n\\nvery fear added incitement to the beasts.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt Kaviri’s camp Tarzan paused only long enough to eat the food that\\n\\nthe blacks furnished, and arrange with the chief for a dozen men to man\\n\\nthe paddles of his canoe.\\n\\n\\n\\nKaviri was only too glad to comply with any demands that the ape-man\\n\\nmight make if only such compliance would hasten the departure of the\\n\\nhorrid pack; but it was easier, he discovered, to promise men than to\\n\\nfurnish them, for when his people learned his intentions those that had\\n\\nnot already fled into the jungle proceeded to do so without loss of\\n\\ntime, so that when Kaviri turned to point out those who were to\\n\\naccompany Tarzan, he discovered that he was the only member of his\\n\\ntribe left within the village.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan could not repress a smile.\\n\\n\\n\\n“They do not seem anxious to accompany us,” he said; “but just remain\\n\\nquietly here, Kaviri, and presently you shall see your people flocking\\n\\nto your side.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the ape-man rose, and, calling his pack about him, commanded that\\n\\nMugambi remain with Kaviri, and disappeared in the jungle with Sheeta\\n\\nand the apes at his heels.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor half an hour the silence of the grim forest was broken only by the\\n\\nordinary sounds of the teeming life that but adds to its lowering\\n\\nloneliness. Kaviri and Mugambi sat alone in the palisaded village,\\n\\nwaiting.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently from a great distance came a hideous sound. Mugambi\\n\\nrecognized the weird challenge of the ape-man. Immediately from\\n\\ndifferent points of the compass rose a horrid semicircle of similar\\n\\nshrieks and screams, punctuated now and again by the blood-curdling cry\\n\\nof a hungry panther.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\nBetrayed\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe two savages, Kaviri and Mugambi, squatting before the entrance to\\n\\nKaviri’s hut, looked at one another—Kaviri with ill-concealed alarm.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What is it?” he whispered.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is Bwana Tarzan and his people,” replied Mugambi. “But what they\\n\\nare doing I know not, unless it be that they are devouring your people\\n\\nwho ran away.”\\n\\n\\n\\nKaviri shuddered and rolled his eyes fearfully toward the jungle. In\\n\\nall his long life in the savage forest he had never heard such an\\n\\nawful, fearsome din.\\n\\n\\n\\nCloser and closer came the sounds, and now with them were mingled the\\n\\nterrified shrieks of women and children and of men. For twenty long\\n\\nminutes the blood-curdling cries continued, until they seemed but a\\n\\nstone’s throw from the palisade. Kaviri rose to flee, but Mugambi\\n\\nseized and held him, for such had been the command of Tarzan.\\n\\n\\n\\nA moment later a horde of terrified natives burst from the jungle,\\n\\nracing toward the shelter of their huts. Like frightened sheep they\\n\\nran, and behind them, driving them as sheep might be driven, came\\n\\nTarzan and Sheeta and the hideous apes of Akut.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently Tarzan stood before Kaviri, the old quiet smile upon his\\n\\nlips.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Your people have returned, my brother,” he said, “and now you may\\n\\nselect those who are to accompany me and paddle my canoe.”\\n\\n\\n\\nTremblingly Kaviri tottered to his feet, calling to his people to come\\n\\nfrom their huts; but none responded to his summons.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Tell them,” suggested Tarzan, “that if they do not come I shall send\\n\\nmy people in after them.”\\n\\n\\n\\nKaviri did as he was bid, and in an instant the entire population of\\n\\nthe village came forth, their wide and frightened eyes rolling from one\\n\\nto another of the savage creatures that wandered about the village\\n\\nstreet.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuickly Kaviri designated a dozen warriors to accompany Tarzan. The\\n\\npoor fellows went almost white with terror at the prospect of close\\n\\ncontact with the panther and the apes in the narrow confines of the\\n\\ncanoes; but when Kaviri explained to them that there was no escape—that\\n\\nBwana Tarzan would pursue them with his grim horde should they attempt\\n\\nto run away from the duty—they finally went gloomily down to the river\\n\\nand took their places in the canoe.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was with a sigh of relief that their chieftain saw the party\\n\\ndisappear about a headland a short distance up-river.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor three days the strange company continued farther and farther into\\n\\nthe heart of the savage country that lies on either side of the almost\\n\\nunexplored Ugambi. Three of the twelve warriors deserted during that\\n\\ntime; but as several of the apes had finally learned the secret of the\\n\\npaddles, Tarzan felt no dismay because of the loss.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, he could have travelled much more rapidly on\\n\\nshore, but he believed that he could hold his own wild crew together to\\n\\nbetter advantage by keeping them to the boat as much as possible. Twice\\n\\na day they landed to hunt and feed, and at night they slept upon the\\n\\nbank of the mainland or on one of the numerous little islands that\\n\\ndotted the river.\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore them the natives fled in alarm, so that they found only deserted\\n\\nvillages in their path as they proceeded. Tarzan was anxious to get in\\n\\ntouch with some of the savages who dwelt upon the river’s banks, but so\\n\\nfar he had been unable to do so.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally he decided to take to the land himself, leaving his company to\\n\\nfollow after him by boat. He explained to Mugambi the thing that he had\\n\\nin mind, and told Akut to follow the directions of the black.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I will join you again in a few days,” he said. “Now I go ahead to\\n\\nlearn what has become of the very bad white man whom I seek.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the next halt Tarzan took to the shore, and was soon lost to the\\n\\nview of his people.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first few villages he came to were deserted, showing that news of\\n\\nthe coming of his pack had travelled rapidly; but toward evening he\\n\\ncame upon a distant cluster of thatched huts surrounded by a rude\\n\\npalisade, within which were a couple of hundred natives.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe women were preparing the evening meal as Tarzan of the Apes poised\\n\\nabove them in the branches of a giant tree which overhung the palisade\\n\\nat one point.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ape-man was at a loss as to how he might enter into communication\\n\\nwith these people without either frightening them or arousing their\\n\\nsavage love of battle. He had no desire to fight now, for he was upon a\\n\\nmuch more important mission than that of battling with every chance\\n\\ntribe that he should happen to meet with.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt last he hit upon a plan, and after seeing that he was concealed from\\n\\nthe view of those below, he gave a few hoarse grunts in imitation of a\\n\\npanther. All eyes immediately turned upward toward the foliage above.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was growing dark, and they could not penetrate the leafy screen\\n\\nwhich shielded the ape-man from their view. The moment that he had won\\n\\ntheir attention he raised his voice to the shriller and more hideous\\n\\nscream of the beast he personated, and then, scarce stirring a leaf in\\n\\nhis descent, dropped to the ground once again outside the palisade,\\n\\nand, with the speed of a deer, ran quickly round to the village gate.\\n\\n\\n\\nHere he beat upon the fibre-bound saplings of which the barrier was\\n\\nconstructed, shouting to the natives in their own tongue that he was a\\n\\nfriend who wished food and shelter for the night.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan knew well the nature of the black man. He was aware that the\\n\\ngrunting and screaming of Sheeta in the tree above them would set their\\n\\nnerves on edge, and that his pounding upon their gate after dark would\\n\\nstill further add to their terror.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat they did not reply to his hail was no surprise, for natives are\\n\\nfearful of any voice that comes out of the night from beyond their\\n\\npalisades, attributing it always to some demon or other ghostly\\n\\nvisitor; but still he continued to call.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Let me in, my friends!” he cried. “I am a white man pursuing the very\\n\\nbad white man who passed this way a few days ago. I follow to punish\\n\\nhim for the sins he has committed against you and me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“If you doubt my friendship, I will prove it to you by going into the\\n\\ntree above your village and driving Sheeta back into the jungle before\\n\\nhe leaps among you. If you will not promise to take me in and treat me\\n\\nas a friend I shall let Sheeta stay and devour you.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a moment there was silence. Then the voice of an old man came out\\n\\nof the quiet of the village street.\\n\\n\\n\\n“If you are indeed a white man and a friend, we will let you come in;\\n\\nbut first you must drive Sheeta away.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Very well,” replied Tarzan. “Listen, and you shall hear Sheeta fleeing\\n\\nbefore me.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ape-man returned quickly to the tree, and this time he made a great\\n\\nnoise as he entered the branches, at the same time growling ominously\\n\\nafter the manner of the panther, so that those below would believe that\\n\\nthe great beast was still there.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen he reached a point well above the village street he made a great\\n\\ncommotion, shaking the tree violently, crying aloud to the panther to\\n\\nflee or be killed, and punctuating his own voice with the screams and\\n\\nmouthings of an angry beast.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently he raced toward the opposite side of the tree and off into\\n\\nthe jungle, pounding loudly against the boles of trees as he went, and\\n\\nvoicing the panther’s diminishing growls as he drew farther and farther\\n\\naway from the village.\\n\\n\\n\\nA few minutes later he returned to the village gate, calling to the\\n\\nnatives within.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I have driven Sheeta away,” he said. “Now come and admit me as you\\n\\npromised.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a time there was the sound of excited discussion within the\\n\\npalisade, but at length a half-dozen warriors came and opened the\\n\\ngates, peering anxiously out in evident trepidation as to the nature of\\n\\nthe creature which they should find waiting there. They were not much\\n\\nrelieved at sight of an almost naked white man; but when Tarzan had\\n\\nreassured them in quiet tones, protesting his friendship for them, they\\n\\nopened the barrier a trifle farther and admitted him.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the gates had been once more secured the self-confidence of the\\n\\nsavages returned, and as Tarzan walked up the village street toward the\\n\\nchief’s hut he was surrounded by a host of curious men, women, and\\n\\nchildren.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom the chief he learned that Rokoff had passed up the river a week\\n\\nprevious, and that he had horns growing from his forehead, and was\\n\\naccompanied by a thousand devils. Later the chief said that the very\\n\\nbad white man had remained a month in his village.\\n\\n\\n\\nThough none of these statements agreed with Kaviri’s, that the Russian\\n\\nwas but three days gone from the chieftain’s village and that his\\n\\nfollowing was much smaller than now stated, Tarzan was in no manner\\n\\nsurprised at the discrepancies, for he was quite familiar with the\\n\\nsavage mind’s strange manner of functioning.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat he was most interested in knowing was that he was upon the right\\n\\ntrail, and that it led toward the interior. In this circumstance he\\n\\nknew that Rokoff could never escape him.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter several hours of questioning and cross-questioning the ape-man\\n\\nlearned that another party had preceded the Russian by several\\n\\ndays—three whites—a man, a woman, and a little man-child, with several\\n\\nMosulas.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan explained to the chief that his people would follow him in a\\n\\ncanoe, probably the next day, and that though he might go on ahead of\\n\\nthem the chief was to receive them kindly and have no fear of them, for\\n\\nMugambi would see that they did not harm the chief’s people, if they\\n\\nwere accorded a friendly reception.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And now,” he concluded, “I shall lie down beneath this tree and sleep.\\n\\nI am very tired. Permit no one to disturb me.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe chief offered him a hut, but Tarzan, from past experience of native\\n\\ndwellings, preferred the open air, and, further, he had plans of his\\n\\nown that could be better carried out if he remained beneath the tree.\\n\\nHe gave as his reason a desire to be close at hand should Sheeta\\n\\nreturn, and after this explanation the chief was very glad to permit\\n\\nhim to sleep beneath the tree.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan had always found that it stood him in good stead to leave with\\n\\nnatives the impression that he was to some extent possessed of more or\\n\\nless miraculous powers. He might easily have entered their village\\n\\nwithout recourse to the gates, but he believed that a sudden and\\n\\nunaccountable disappearance when he was ready to leave them would\\n\\nresult in a more lasting impression upon their childlike minds, and so\\n\\nas soon as the village was quiet in sleep he rose, and, leaping into\\n\\nthe branches of the tree above him, faded silently into the black\\n\\nmystery of the jungle night.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll the balance of that night the ape-man swung rapidly through the\\n\\nupper and middle terraces of the forest. When the going was good there\\n\\nhe preferred the upper branches of the giant trees, for then his way\\n\\nwas better lighted by the moon; but so accustomed were all his senses\\n\\nto the grim world of his birth that it was possible for him, even in\\n\\nthe dense, black shadows near the ground, to move with ease and\\n\\nrapidity. You or I walking beneath the arcs of Main Street, or\\n\\nBroadway, or State Street, could not have moved more surely or with a\\n\\ntenth the speed of the agile ape-man through the gloomy mazes that\\n\\nwould have baffled us entirely.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt dawn he stopped to feed, and then he slept for several hours, taking\\n\\nup the pursuit again toward noon.\\n\\n\\n\\nTwice he came upon natives, and, though he had considerable difficulty\\n\\nin approaching them, he succeeded in each instance in quieting both\\n\\ntheir fears and bellicose intentions toward him, and learned from them\\n\\nthat he was upon the trail of the Russian.\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo days later, still following up the Ugambi, he came upon a large\\n\\nvillage. The chief, a wicked-looking fellow with the sharp-filed teeth\\n\\nthat often denote the cannibal, received him with apparent\\n\\nfriendliness.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ape-man was now thoroughly fatigued, and had determined to rest for\\n\\neight or ten hours that he might be fresh and strong when he caught up\\n\\nwith Rokoff, as he was sure he must do within a very short time.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe chief told him that the bearded white man had left his village only\\n\\nthe morning before, and that doubtless he would be able to overtake him\\n\\nin a short time. The other party the chief had not seen or heard of, so\\n\\nhe said.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan did not like the appearance or manner of the fellow, who seemed,\\n\\nthough friendly enough, to harbour a certain contempt for this\\n\\nhalf-naked white man who came with no followers and offered no\\n\\npresents; but he needed the rest and food that the village would afford\\n\\nhim with less effort than the jungle, and so, as he knew no fear of\\n\\nman, beast, or devil, he curled himself up in the shadow of a hut and\\n\\nwas soon asleep.\\n\\n\\n\\nScarcely had he left the chief than the latter called two of his\\n\\nwarriors, to whom he whispered a few instructions. A moment later the\\n\\nsleek, black bodies were racing along the river path, up-stream, toward\\n\\nthe east.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the village the chief maintained perfect quiet. He would permit no\\n\\none to approach the sleeping visitor, nor any singing, nor loud\\n\\ntalking. He was remarkably solicitous lest his guest be disturbed.\\n\\n\\n\\nThree hours later several canoes came silently into view from up the\\n\\nUgambi. They were being pushed ahead rapidly by the brawny muscles of\\n\\ntheir black crews. Upon the bank before the river stood the chief, his\\n\\nspear raised in a horizontal position above his head, as though in some\\n\\nmanner of predetermined signal to those within the boats.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd such indeed was the purpose of his attitude—which meant that the\\n\\nwhite stranger within his village still slept peacefully.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the bows of two of the canoes were the runners that the chief had\\n\\nsent forth three hours earlier. It was evident that they had been\\n\\ndispatched to follow and bring back this party, and that the signal\\n\\nfrom the bank was one that had been determined upon before they left\\n\\nthe village.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a few moments the dugouts drew up to the verdure-clad bank. The\\n\\nnative warriors filed out, and with them a half-dozen white men.\\n\\nSullen, ugly-looking customers they were, and none more so than the\\n\\nevil-faced, black-bearded man who commanded them.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Where is the white man your messengers report to be with you?” he\\n\\nasked of the chief.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This way, bwana,” replied the native. “Carefully have I kept silence\\n\\nin the village that he might be still asleep when you returned. I do\\n\\nnot know that he is one who seeks you to do you harm, but he questioned\\n\\nme closely about your coming and your going, and his appearance is as\\n\\nthat of the one you described, but whom you believed safe in the\\n\\ncountry which you called Jungle Island.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Had you not told me this tale I should not have recognized him, and\\n\\nthen he might have gone after and slain you. If he is a friend and no\\n\\nenemy, then no harm has been done, bwana; but if he proves to be an\\n\\nenemy, I should like very much to have a rifle and some ammunition.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You have done well,” replied the white man, “and you shall have the\\n\\nrifle and ammunition whether he be a friend or enemy, provided that you\\n\\nstand with me.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I shall stand with you, bwana,” said the chief, “and now come and look\\n\\nupon the stranger, who sleeps within my village.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSo saying, he turned and led the way toward the hut, in the shadow of\\n\\nwhich the unconscious Tarzan slept peacefully.\\n\\n\\n\\nBehind the two men came the remaining whites and a score of warriors;\\n\\nbut the raised forefingers of the chief and his companion held them all\\n\\nto perfect silence.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs they turned the corner of the hut, cautiously and upon tiptoe, an\\n\\nugly smile touched the lips of the white as his eyes fell upon the\\n\\ngiant figure of the sleeping ape-man.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe chief looked at the other inquiringly. The latter nodded his head,\\n\\nto signify that the chief had made no mistake in his suspicions. Then\\n\\nhe turned to those behind him and, pointing to the sleeping man,\\n\\nmotioned for them to seize and bind him.\\n\\n\\n\\nA moment later a dozen brutes had leaped upon the surprised Tarzan, and\\n\\nso quickly did they work that he was securely bound before he could\\n\\nmake half an effort to escape.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen they threw him down upon his back, and as his eyes turned toward\\n\\nthe crowd that stood near, they fell upon the malign face of Nikolas\\n\\nRokoff.\\n\\n\\n\\nA sneer curled the Russian’s lips. He stepped quite close to Tarzan.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Pig!” he cried. “Have you not learned sufficient wisdom to keep away\\n\\nfrom Nikolas Rokoff?”\\n\\n\\n\\nThen he kicked the prostrate man full in the face.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That for your welcome,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Tonight, before my Ethiop friends eat you, I shall tell you what has\\n\\nalready befallen your wife and child, and what further plans I have for\\n\\ntheir futures.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\nThe Dance of Death\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThrough the luxuriant, tangled vegetation of the Stygian jungle night a\\n\\ngreat lithe body made its way sinuously and in utter silence upon its\\n\\nsoft padded feet. Only two blazing points of yellow-green flame shone\\n\\noccasionally with the reflected light of the equatorial moon that now\\n\\nand again pierced the softly sighing roof rustling in the night wind.\\n\\n\\n\\nOccasionally the beast would stop with high-held nose, sniffing\\n\\nsearchingly. At other times a quick, brief incursion into the branches\\n\\nabove delayed it momentarily in its steady journey toward the east. To\\n\\nits sensitive nostrils came the subtle unseen spoor of many a tender\\n\\nfour-footed creature, bringing the slaver of hunger to the cruel,\\n\\ndrooping jowl.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut steadfastly it kept on its way, strangely ignoring the cravings of\\n\\nappetite that at another time would have sent the rolling, fur-clad\\n\\nmuscles flying at some soft throat.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll that night the creature pursued its lonely way, and the next day it\\n\\nhalted only to make a single kill, which it tore to fragments and\\n\\ndevoured with sullen, grumbling rumbles as though half famished for\\n\\nlack of food.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was dusk when it approached the palisade that surrounded a large\\n\\nnative village. Like the shadow of a swift and silent death it circled\\n\\nthe village, nose to ground, halting at last close to the palisade,\\n\\nwhere it almost touched the backs of several huts. Here the beast\\n\\nsniffed for a moment, and then, turning its head upon one side,\\n\\nlistened with up-pricked ears.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat it heard was no sound by the standards of human ears, yet to the\\n\\nhighly attuned and delicate organs of the beast a message seemed to be\\n\\nborne to the savage brain. A wondrous transformation was wrought in the\\n\\nmotionless mass of statuesque bone and muscle that had an instant\\n\\nbefore stood as though carved out of the living bronze.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs if it had been poised upon steel springs, suddenly released, it rose\\n\\nquickly and silently to the top of the palisade, disappearing,\\n\\nstealthily and cat-like, into the dark space between the wall and the\\n\\nback of an adjacent hut.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the village street beyond women were preparing many little fires and\\n\\nfetching cooking-pots filled with water, for a great feast was to be\\n\\ncelebrated ere the night was many hours older. About a stout stake near\\n\\nthe centre of the circling fires a little knot of black warriors stood\\n\\nconversing, their bodies smeared with white and blue and ochre in broad\\n\\nand grotesque bands. Great circles of colour were drawn about their\\n\\neyes and lips, their breasts and abdomens, and from their\\n\\nclay-plastered coiffures rose gay feathers and bits of long, straight\\n\\nwire.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe village was preparing for the feast, while in a hut at one side of\\n\\nthe scene of the coming orgy the bound victim of their bestial\\n\\nappetites lay waiting for the end. And such an end!\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan of the Apes, tensing his mighty muscles, strained at the bonds\\n\\nthat pinioned him; but they had been re-enforced many times at the\\n\\ninstigation of the Russian, so that not even the ape-man’s giant brawn\\n\\ncould budge them.\\n\\n\\n\\nDeath!\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan had looked the Hideous Hunter in the face many a time, and\\n\\nsmiled. And he would smile again tonight when he knew the end was\\n\\ncoming quickly; but now his thoughts were not of himself, but of those\\n\\nothers—the dear ones who must suffer most because of his passing.\\n\\n\\n\\nJane would never know the manner of it. For that he thanked Heaven; and\\n\\nhe was thankful also that she at least was safe in the heart of the\\n\\nworld’s greatest city. Safe among kind and loving friends who would do\\n\\ntheir best to lighten her misery.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the boy!\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan writhed at the thought of him. His son! And now he—the mighty\\n\\nLord of the Jungle—he, Tarzan, King of the Apes, the only one in all\\n\\nthe world fitted to find and save the child from the horrors that\\n\\nRokoff’s evil mind had planned—had been trapped like a silly, dumb\\n\\ncreature. He was to die in a few hours, and with him would go the\\n\\nchild’s last chance of succour.\\n\\n\\n\\nRokoff had been in to see and revile and abuse him several times during\\n\\nthe afternoon; but he had been able to wring no word of remonstrance or\\n\\nmurmur of pain from the lips of the giant captive.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo at last he had given up, reserving his particular bit of exquisite\\n\\nmental torture for the last moment, when, just before the savage spears\\n\\nof the cannibals should for ever make the object of his hatred immune\\n\\nto further suffering, the Russian planned to reveal to his enemy the\\n\\ntrue whereabouts of his wife whom he thought safe in England.\\n\\n\\n\\nDusk had fallen upon the village, and the ape-man could hear the\\n\\npreparations going forward for the torture and the feast. The dance of\\n\\ndeath he could picture in his mind’s eye—for he had seen the thing many\\n\\ntimes in the past. Now he was to be the central figure, bound to the\\n\\nstake.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe torture of the slow death as the circling warriors cut him to bits\\n\\nwith the fiendish skill, that mutilated without bringing\\n\\nunconsciousness, had no terrors for him. He was inured to suffering and\\n\\nto the sight of blood and to cruel death; but the desire to live was no\\n\\nless strong within him, and until the last spark of life should flicker\\n\\nand go out, his whole being would remain quick with hope and\\n\\ndetermination. Let them relax their watchfulness but for an instant, he\\n\\nknew that his cunning mind and giant muscles would find a way to\\n\\nescape—escape and revenge.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he lay, thinking furiously on every possibility of self-salvation,\\n\\nthere came to his sensitive nostrils a faint and a familiar scent.\\n\\nInstantly every faculty of his mind was upon the alert. Presently his\\n\\ntrained ears caught the sound of the soundless presence without—behind\\n\\nthe hut wherein he lay. His lips moved, and though no sound came forth\\n\\nthat might have been appreciable to a human ear beyond the walls of his\\n\\nprison, yet he realized that the one beyond would hear. Already he knew\\n\\nwho that one was, for his nostrils had told him as plainly as your eyes\\n\\nor mine tell us of the identity of an old friend whom we come upon in\\n\\nbroad daylight.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn instant later he heard the soft sound of a fur-clad body and padded\\n\\nfeet scaling the outer wall behind the hut and then a tearing at the\\n\\npoles which formed the wall. Presently through the hole thus made slunk\\n\\na great beast, pressing its cold muzzle close to his neck.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was Sheeta, the panther.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe beast snuffed round the prostrate man, whining a little. There was\\n\\na limit to the interchange of ideas which could take place between\\n\\nthese two, and so Tarzan could not be sure that Sheeta understood all\\n\\nthat he attempted to communicate to him. That the man was tied and\\n\\nhelpless Sheeta could, of course, see; but that to the mind of the\\n\\npanther this would carry any suggestion of harm in so far as his master\\n\\nwas concerned, Tarzan could not guess.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat had brought the beast to him? The fact that he had come augured\\n\\nwell for what he might accomplish; but when Tarzan tried to get Sheeta\\n\\nto gnaw his bonds asunder the great animal could not seem to understand\\n\\nwhat was expected of him, and, instead, but licked the wrists and arms\\n\\nof the prisoner.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently there came an interruption. Some one was approaching the hut.\\n\\nSheeta gave a low growl and slunk into the blackness of a far corner.\\n\\nEvidently the visitor did not hear the warning sound, for almost\\n\\nimmediately he entered the hut—a tall, naked, savage warrior.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe came to Tarzan’s side and pricked him with a spear. From the lips of\\n\\nthe ape-man came a weird, uncanny sound, and in answer to it there\\n\\nleaped from the blackness of the hut’s farthermost corner a bolt of\\n\\nfur-clad death. Full upon the breast of the painted savage the great\\n\\nbeast struck, burying sharp talons in the black flesh and sinking great\\n\\nyellow fangs in the ebon throat.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a fearful scream of anguish and terror from the black, and\\n\\nmingled with it was the hideous challenge of the killing panther. Then\\n\\ncame silence—silence except for the rending of bloody flesh and the\\n\\ncrunching of human bones between mighty jaws.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe noise had brought sudden quiet to the village without. Then there\\n\\ncame the sound of voices in consultation.\\n\\n\\n\\nHigh-pitched, fear-filled voices, and deep, low tones of authority, as\\n\\nthe chief spoke. Tarzan and the panther heard the approaching footsteps\\n\\nof many men, and then, to Tarzan’s surprise, the great cat rose from\\n\\nacross the body of its kill, and slunk noiselessly from the hut through\\n\\nthe aperture through which it had entered.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe man heard the soft scraping of the body as it passed over the top\\n\\nof the palisade, and then silence. From the opposite side of the hut he\\n\\nheard the savages approaching to investigate.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had little hope that Sheeta would return, for had the great cat\\n\\nintended to defend him against all comers it would have remained by his\\n\\nside as it heard the approaching savages without.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan knew how strange were the workings of the brains of the mighty\\n\\ncarnivora of the jungle—how fiendishly fearless they might be in the\\n\\nface of certain death, and again how timid upon the slightest\\n\\nprovocation. There was doubt in his mind that some note of the\\n\\napproaching blacks vibrating with fear had struck an answering chord in\\n\\nthe nervous system of the panther, sending him slinking through the\\n\\njungle, his tail between his legs.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe man shrugged. Well, what of it? He had expected to die, and, after\\n\\nall, what might Sheeta have done for him other than to maul a couple of\\n\\nhis enemies before a rifle in the hands of one of the whites should\\n\\nhave dispatched him!\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the cat could have released him! Ah! that would have resulted in a\\n\\nvery different story; but it had proved beyond the understanding of\\n\\nSheeta, and now the beast was gone and Tarzan must definitely abandon\\n\\nhope.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe natives were at the entrance to the hut now, peering fearfully into\\n\\nthe dark interior. Two in advance held lighted torches in their left\\n\\nhands and ready spears in their right. They held back timorously\\n\\nagainst those behind, who were pushing them forward.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe shrieks of the panther’s victim, mingled with those of the great\\n\\ncat, had wrought mightily upon their poor nerves, and now the awful\\n\\nsilence of the dark interior seemed even more terribly ominous than had\\n\\nthe frightful screaming.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently one of those who was being forced unwillingly within hit upon\\n\\na happy scheme for learning first the precise nature of the danger\\n\\nwhich menaced him from the silent interior. With a quick movement he\\n\\nflung his lighted torch into the centre of the hut. Instantly all\\n\\nwithin was illuminated for a brief second before the burning brand was\\n\\ndashed out against the earth floor.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was the figure of the white prisoner still securely bound as they\\n\\nhad last seen him, and in the centre of the hut another figure equally\\n\\nas motionless, its throat and breasts horribly torn and mangled.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sight that met the eyes of the foremost savages inspired more\\n\\nterror within their superstitious breasts than would the presence of\\n\\nSheeta, for they saw only the result of a ferocious attack upon one of\\n\\ntheir fellows.\\n\\n\\n\\nNot seeing the cause, their fear-ridden minds were free to attribute\\n\\nthe ghastly work to supernatural causes, and with the thought they\\n\\nturned, screaming, from the hut, bowling over those who stood directly\\n\\nbehind them in the exuberance of their terror.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor an hour Tarzan heard only the murmur of excited voices from the far\\n\\nend of the village. Evidently the savages were once more attempting to\\n\\nwork up their flickering courage to a point that would permit them to\\n\\nmake another invasion of the hut, for now and then came a savage yell,\\n\\nsuch as the warriors give to bolster up their bravery upon the field of\\n\\nbattle.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut in the end it was two of the whites who first entered, carrying\\n\\ntorches and guns. Tarzan was not surprised to discover that neither of\\n\\nthem was Rokoff. He would have wagered his soul that no power on earth\\n\\ncould have tempted that great coward to face the unknown menace of the\\n\\nhut.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the natives saw that the white men were not attacked they, too,\\n\\ncrowded into the interior, their voices hushed with terror as they\\n\\nlooked upon the mutilated corpse of their comrade. The whites tried in\\n\\nvain to elicit an explanation from Tarzan; but to all their queries he\\n\\nbut shook his head, a grim and knowing smile curving his lips.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt last Rokoff came.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis face grew very white as his eyes rested upon the bloody thing\\n\\ngrinning up at him from the floor, the face set in a death mask of\\n\\nexcruciating horror.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come!” he said to the chief. “Let us get to work and finish this demon\\n\\nbefore he has an opportunity to repeat this thing upon more of your\\n\\npeople.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe chief gave orders that Tarzan should be lifted and carried to the\\n\\nstake; but it was several minutes before he could prevail upon any of\\n\\nhis men to touch the prisoner.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt last, however, four of the younger warriors dragged Tarzan roughly\\n\\nfrom the hut, and once outside the pall of terror seemed lifted from\\n\\nthe savage hearts.\\n\\n\\n\\nA score of howling blacks pushed and buffeted the prisoner down the\\n\\nvillage street and bound him to the post in the centre of the circle of\\n\\nlittle fires and boiling cooking-pots.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen at last he was made fast and seemed quite helpless and beyond the\\n\\nfaintest hope of succour, Rokoff’s shrivelled wart of courage swelled\\n\\nto its usual proportions when danger was not present.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe stepped close to the ape-man, and, seizing a spear from the hands of\\n\\none of the savages, was the first to prod the helpless victim. A little\\n\\nstream of blood trickled down the giant’s smooth skin from the wound in\\n\\nhis side; but no murmur of pain passed his lips.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe smile of contempt upon his face seemed to infuriate the Russian.\\n\\nWith a volley of oaths he leaped at the helpless captive, beating him\\n\\nupon the face with his clenched fists and kicking him mercilessly about\\n\\nthe legs.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen he raised the heavy spear to drive it through the mighty heart,\\n\\nand still Tarzan of the Apes smiled contemptuously upon him.\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore Rokoff could drive the weapon home the chief sprang upon him and\\n\\ndragged him away from his intended victim.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Stop, white man!” he cried. “Rob us of this prisoner and our\\n\\ndeath-dance, and you yourself may have to take his place.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe threat proved most effective in keeping the Russian from further\\n\\nassaults upon the prisoner, though he continued to stand a little apart\\n\\nand hurl taunts at his enemy. He told Tarzan that he himself was going\\n\\nto eat the ape-man’s heart. He enlarged upon the horrors of the future\\n\\nlife of Tarzan’s son, and intimated that his vengeance would reach as\\n\\nwell to Jane Clayton.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You think your wife safe in England,” said Rokoff. “Poor fool! She is\\n\\neven now in the hands of one not even of decent birth, and far from the\\n\\nsafety of London and the protection of her friends. I had not meant to\\n\\ntell you this until I could bring to you upon Jungle Island proof of\\n\\nher fate.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now that you are about to die the most unthinkably horrid death that\\n\\nit is given a white man to die—let this word of the plight of your wife\\n\\nadd to the torments that you must suffer before the last savage\\n\\nspear-thrust releases you from your torture.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe dance had commenced now, and the yells of the circling warriors\\n\\ndrowned Rokoff’s further attempts to distress his victim.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe leaping savages, the flickering firelight playing upon their\\n\\npainted bodies, circled about the victim at the stake.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo Tarzan’s memory came a similar scene, when he had rescued D’Arnot\\n\\nfrom a like predicament at the last moment before the final\\n\\nspear-thrust should have ended his sufferings. Who was there now to\\n\\nrescue him? In all the world there was none able to save him from the\\n\\ntorture and the death.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe thought that these human fiends would devour him when the dance was\\n\\ndone caused him not a single qualm of horror or disgust. It did not add\\n\\nto his sufferings as it would have to those of an ordinary white man,\\n\\nfor all his life Tarzan had seen the beasts of the jungle devour the\\n\\nflesh of their kills.\\n\\n\\n\\nHad he not himself battled for the grisly forearm of a great ape at\\n\\nthat long-gone Dum-Dum, when he had slain the fierce Tublat and won his\\n\\nniche in the respect of the Apes of Kerchak?\\n\\n\\n\\nThe dancers were leaping more closely to him now. The spears were\\n\\ncommencing to find his body in the first torturing pricks that prefaced\\n\\nthe more serious thrusts.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt would not be long now. The ape-man longed for the last savage lunge\\n\\nthat would end his misery.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then, far out in the mazes of the weird jungle, rose a shrill\\n\\nscream.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor an instant the dancers paused, and in the silence of the interval\\n\\nthere rose from the lips of the fast-bound white man an answering\\n\\nshriek, more fearsome and more terrible than that of the jungle-beast\\n\\nthat had roused it.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor several minutes the blacks hesitated; then, at the urging of Rokoff\\n\\nand their chief, they leaped in to finish the dance and the victim; but\\n\\nere ever another spear touched the brown hide a tawny streak of\\n\\ngreen-eyed hate and ferocity bounded from the door of the hut in which\\n\\nTarzan had been imprisoned, and Sheeta, the panther, stood snarling\\n\\nbeside his master.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor an instant the blacks and the whites stood transfixed with terror.\\n\\nTheir eyes were riveted upon the bared fangs of the jungle cat.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnly Tarzan of the Apes saw what else there was emerging from the dark\\n\\ninterior of the hut.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\n\\nChivalry or Villainy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom her cabin port upon the Kincaid, Jane Clayton had seen her husband\\n\\nrowed to the verdure-clad shore of Jungle Island, and then the ship\\n\\nonce more proceeded upon its way.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor several days she saw no one other than Sven Anderssen, the\\n\\nKincaid’s taciturn and repellent cook. She asked him the name of the\\n\\nshore upon which her husband had been set.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ay tank it blow purty soon purty hard,” replied the Swede, and that\\n\\nwas all that she could get out of him.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe had come to the conclusion that he spoke no other English, and so\\n\\nshe ceased to importune him for information; but never did she forget\\n\\nto greet him pleasantly or to thank him for the hideous, nauseating\\n\\nmeals he brought her.\\n\\n\\n\\nThree days from the spot where Tarzan had been marooned the Kincaid\\n\\ncame to anchor in the mouth of a great river, and presently Rokoff came\\n\\nto Jane Clayton’s cabin.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We have arrived, my dear,” he said, with a sickening leer. “I have\\n\\ncome to offer you safety, liberty, and ease. My heart has been softened\\n\\ntoward you in your suffering, and I would make amends as best I may.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Your husband was a brute—you know that best who found him naked in his\\n\\nnative jungle, roaming wild with the savage beasts that were his\\n\\nfellows. Now I am a gentleman, not only born of noble blood, but raised\\n\\ngently as befits a man of quality.\\n\\n\\n\\n“To you, dear Jane, I offer the love of a cultured man and association\\n\\nwith one of culture and refinement, which you must have sorely missed\\n\\nin your relations with the poor ape that through your girlish\\n\\ninfatuation you married so thoughtlessly. I love you, Jane. You have\\n\\nbut to say the word and no further sorrows shall afflict you—even your\\n\\nbaby shall be returned to you unharmed.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOutside the door Sven Anderssen paused with the noonday meal he had\\n\\nbeen carrying to Lady Greystoke. Upon the end of his long, stringy neck\\n\\nhis little head was cocked to one side, his close-set eyes were half\\n\\nclosed, his ears, so expressive was his whole attitude of stealthy\\n\\neavesdropping, seemed truly to be cocked forward—even his long, yellow,\\n\\nstraggly moustache appeared to assume a sly droop.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Rokoff closed his appeal, awaiting the reply he invited, the look of\\n\\nsurprise upon Jane Clayton’s face turned to one of disgust. She fairly\\n\\nshuddered in the fellow’s face.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I would not have been surprised, M. Rokoff,” she said, “had you\\n\\nattempted to force me to submit to your evil desires, but that you\\n\\nshould be so fatuous as to believe that I, wife of John Clayton, would\\n\\ncome to you willingly, even to save my life, I should never have\\n\\nimagined. I have known you for a scoundrel, M. Rokoff; but until now I\\n\\nhad not taken you for a fool.”\\n\\n\\n\\nRokoff’s eyes narrowed, and the red of mortification flushed out the\\n\\npallor of his face. He took a step toward the girl, threateningly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We shall see who is the fool at last,” he hissed, “when I have broken\\n\\nyou to my will and your plebeian Yankee stubbornness has cost you all\\n\\nthat you hold dear—even the life of your baby—for, by the bones of St.\\n\\nPeter, I’ll forego all that I had planned for the brat and cut its\\n\\nheart out before your very eyes. You’ll learn what it means to insult\\n\\nNikolas Rokoff.”\\n\\n\\n\\nJane Clayton turned wearily away.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What is the use,” she said, “of expatiating upon the depths to which\\n\\nyour vengeful nature can sink? You cannot move me either by threats or\\n\\ndeeds. My baby cannot judge yet for himself, but I, his mother, can\\n\\nforesee that should it have been given him to survive to man’s estate\\n\\nhe would willingly sacrifice his life for the honour of his mother.\\n\\nLove him as I do, I would not purchase his life at such a price. Did I,\\n\\nhe would execrate my memory to the day of his death.”\\n\\n\\n\\nRokoff was now thoroughly angered because of his failure to reduce the\\n\\ngirl to terror. He felt only hate for her, but it had come to his\\n\\ndiseased mind that if he could force her to accede to his demands as\\n\\nthe price of her life and her child’s, the cup of his revenge would be\\n\\nfilled to brimming when he could flaunt the wife of Lord Greystoke in\\n\\nthe capitals of Europe as his mistress.\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain he stepped closer to her. His evil face was convulsed with rage\\n\\nand desire. Like a wild beast he sprang upon her, and with his strong\\n\\nfingers at her throat forced her backward upon the berth.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the same instant the door of the cabin opened noisily. Rokoff leaped\\n\\nto his feet, and, turning, faced the Swede cook.\\n\\n\\n\\nInto the fellow’s usually foxy eyes had come an expression of utter\\n\\nstupidity. His lower jaw drooped in vacuous harmony. He busied himself\\n\\nin arranging Lady Greystoke’s meal upon the tiny table at one side of\\n\\nher cabin.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Russian glared at him.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What do you mean,” he cried, “by entering here without permission? Get\\n\\nout!”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe cook turned his watery blue eyes upon Rokoff and smiled vacuously.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ay tank it blow purty soon purty hard,” he said, and then he began\\n\\nrearranging the few dishes upon the little table.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Get out of here, or I’ll throw you out, you miserable blockhead!”\\n\\nroared Rokoff, taking a threatening step toward the Swede.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnderssen continued to smile foolishly in his direction, but one\\n\\nham-like paw slid stealthily to the handle of the long, slim knife that\\n\\nprotruded from the greasy cord supporting his soiled apron.\\n\\n\\n\\nRokoff saw the move and stopped short in his advance. Then he turned\\n\\ntoward Jane Clayton.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I will give you until tomorrow,” he said, “to reconsider your answer\\n\\nto my offer. All will be sent ashore upon one pretext or another except\\n\\nyou and the child, Paulvitch and myself. Then without interruption you\\n\\nwill be able to witness the death of the baby.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe spoke in French that the cook might not understand the sinister\\n\\nportent of his words. When he had done he banged out of the cabin\\n\\nwithout another look at the man who had interrupted him in his sorry\\n\\nwork.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen he had gone, Sven Anderssen turned toward Lady Greystoke—the\\n\\nidiotic expression that had masked his thoughts had fallen away, and in\\n\\nits place was one of craft and cunning.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Hay tank Ay ban a fool,” he said. “Hay ben the fool. Ay savvy Franch.”\\n\\n\\n\\nJane Clayton looked at him in surprise.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You understood all that he said, then?”\\n\\n\\n\\nAnderssen grinned.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You bat,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And you heard what was going on in here and came to protect me?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You bane good to me,” explained the Swede. “Hay treat me like darty\\n\\ndog. Ay help you, lady. You yust vait—Ay help you. Ay ban Vast Coast\\n\\nlots times.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“But how can you help me, Sven,” she asked, “when all these men will be\\n\\nagainst us?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ay tank,” said Sven Anderssen, “it blow purty soon purty hard,” and\\n\\nthen he turned and left the cabin.\\n\\n\\n\\nThough Jane Clayton doubted the cook’s ability to be of any material\\n\\nservice to her, she was nevertheless deeply grateful to him for what he\\n\\nalready had done. The feeling that among these enemies she had one\\n\\nfriend brought the first ray of comfort that had come to lighten the\\n\\nburden of her miserable apprehensions throughout the long voyage of the\\n\\nKincaid.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe saw no more of Rokoff that day, nor of any other until Sven came\\n\\nwith her evening meal. She tried to draw him into conversation relative\\n\\nto his plans to aid her, but all that she could get from him was his\\n\\nstereotyped prophecy as to the future state of the wind. He seemed\\n\\nsuddenly to have relapsed into his wonted state of dense stupidity.\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, when he was leaving her cabin a little later with the empty\\n\\ndishes he whispered very low, “Leave on your clothes an’ roll up your\\n\\nblankets. Ay come back after you purty soon.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe would have slipped from the room at once, but Jane laid her hand\\n\\nupon his sleeve.\\n\\n\\n\\n“My baby?” she asked. “I cannot go without him.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You do wot Ay tal you,” said Anderssen, scowling. “Ay ban halpin’ you,\\n\\nso don’t you gat too fonny.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen he had gone Jane Clayton sank down upon her berth in utter\\n\\nbewilderment. What was she to do? Suspicions as to the intentions of\\n\\nthe Swede swarmed her brain. Might she not be infinitely worse off if\\n\\nshe gave herself into his power than she already was?\\n\\n\\n\\nNo, she could be no worse off in company with the devil himself than\\n\\nwith Nikolas Rokoff, for the devil at least bore the reputation of\\n\\nbeing a gentleman.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe swore a dozen times that she would not leave the Kincaid without\\n\\nher baby, and yet she remained clothed long past her usual hour for\\n\\nretiring, and her blankets were neatly rolled and bound with stout\\n\\ncord, when about midnight there came a stealthy scratching upon the\\n\\npanels of her door.\\n\\n\\n\\nSwiftly she crossed the room and drew the bolt. Softly the door swung\\n\\nopen to admit the muffled figure of the Swede. On one arm he carried a\\n\\nbundle, evidently his blankets. His other hand was raised in a gesture\\n\\ncommanding silence, a grimy forefinger upon his lips.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe came quite close to her.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Carry this,” he said. “Do not make some noise when you see it. It ban\\n\\nyour kid.”\\n\\n\\n\\nQuick hands snatched the bundle from the cook, and hungry mother arms\\n\\nfolded the sleeping infant to her breast, while hot tears of joy ran\\n\\ndown her cheeks and her whole frame shook with the emotion of the\\n\\nmoment.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come!” said Anderssen. “We got no time to vaste.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe snatched up her bundle of blankets, and outside the cabin door his\\n\\nown as well. Then he led her to the ship’s side, steadied her descent\\n\\nof the monkey-ladder, holding the child for her as she climbed to the\\n\\nwaiting boat below. A moment later he had cut the rope that held the\\n\\nsmall boat to the steamer’s side, and, bending silently to the muffled\\n\\noars, was pulling toward the black shadows up the Ugambi River.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnderssen rowed on as though quite sure of his ground, and when after\\n\\nhalf an hour the moon broke through the clouds there was revealed upon\\n\\ntheir left the mouth of a tributary running into the Ugambi. Up this\\n\\nnarrow channel the Swede turned the prow of the small boat.\\n\\n\\n\\nJane Clayton wondered if the man knew where he was bound. She did not\\n\\nknow that in his capacity as cook he had that day been rowed up this\\n\\nvery stream to a little village where he had bartered with the natives\\n\\nfor such provisions as they had for sale, and that he had there\\n\\narranged the details of his plan for the adventure upon which they were\\n\\nnow setting forth.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven though the moon was full, the surface of the small river was quite\\n\\ndark. The giant trees overhung its narrow banks, meeting in a great\\n\\narch above the centre of the river. Spanish moss dropped from the\\n\\ngracefully bending limbs, and enormous creepers clambered in riotous\\n\\nprofusion from the ground to the loftiest branch, falling in curving\\n\\nloops almost to the water’s placid breast.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow and then the river’s surface would be suddenly broken ahead of them\\n\\nby a huge crocodile, startled by the splashing of the oars, or,\\n\\nsnorting and blowing, a family of hippos would dive from a sandy bar to\\n\\nthe cool, safe depths of the bottom.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom the dense jungles upon either side came the weird night cries of\\n\\nthe carnivora—the maniacal voice of the hyena, the coughing grunt of\\n\\nthe panther, the deep and awful roar of the lion. And with them\\n\\nstrange, uncanny notes that the girl could not ascribe to any\\n\\nparticular night prowler—more terrible because of their mystery.\\n\\n\\n\\nHuddled in the stern of the boat she sat with her baby strained close\\n\\nto her bosom, and because of that little tender, helpless thing she was\\n\\nhappier tonight than she had been for many a sorrow-ridden day.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven though she knew not to what fate she was going, or how soon that\\n\\nfate might overtake her, still was she happy and thankful for the\\n\\nmoment, however brief, that she might press her baby tightly in her\\n\\narms. She could scarce wait for the coming of the day that she might\\n\\nlook again upon the bright face of her little, black-eyed Jack.\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain and again she tried to strain her eyes through the blackness of\\n\\nthe jungle night to have but a tiny peep at those beloved features, but\\n\\nonly the dim outline of the baby face rewarded her efforts. Then once\\n\\nmore she would cuddle the warm, little bundle close to her throbbing\\n\\nheart.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt must have been close to three o’clock in the morning that Anderssen\\n\\nbrought the boat’s nose to the shore before a clearing where could be\\n\\ndimly seen in the waning moonlight a cluster of native huts encircled\\n\\nby a thorn boma.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the village gate they were admitted by a native woman, the wife of\\n\\nthe chief whom Anderssen had paid to assist him. She took them to the\\n\\nchief’s hut, but Anderssen said that they would sleep without upon the\\n\\nground, and so, her duty having been completed, she left them to their\\n\\nown devices.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Swede, after explaining in his gruff way that the huts were\\n\\ndoubtless filthy and vermin-ridden, spread Jane’s blankets on the\\n\\nground for her, and at a little distance unrolled his own and lay down\\n\\nto sleep.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was some time before the girl could find a comfortable position upon\\n\\nthe hard ground, but at last, the baby in the hollow of her arm, she\\n\\ndropped asleep from utter exhaustion. When she awoke it was broad\\n\\ndaylight.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout her were clustered a score of curious natives—mostly men, for\\n\\namong the aborigines it is the male who owns this characteristic in its\\n\\nmost exaggerated form. Instinctively Jane Clayton drew the baby more\\n\\nclosely to her, though she soon saw that the blacks were far from\\n\\nintending her or the child any harm.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn fact, one of them offered her a gourd of milk—a filthy,\\n\\nsmoke-begrimed gourd, with the ancient rind of long-curdled milk caked\\n\\nin layers within its neck; but the spirit of the giver touched her\\n\\ndeeply, and her face lightened for a moment with one of those almost\\n\\nforgotten smiles of radiance that had helped to make her beauty famous\\n\\nboth in Baltimore and London.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe took the gourd in one hand, and rather than cause the giver pain\\n\\nraised it to her lips, though for the life of her she could scarce\\n\\nrestrain the qualm of nausea that surged through her as the malodorous\\n\\nthing approached her nostrils.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was Anderssen who came to her rescue, and taking the gourd from her,\\n\\ndrank a portion himself, and then returned it to the native with a gift\\n\\nof blue beads.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sun was shining brightly now, and though the baby still slept, Jane\\n\\ncould scarce restrain her impatient desire to have at least a brief\\n\\nglance at the beloved face. The natives had withdrawn at a command from\\n\\ntheir chief, who now stood talking with Anderssen, a little apart from\\n\\nher.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs she debated the wisdom of risking disturbing the child’s slumber by\\n\\nlifting the blanket that now protected its face from the sun, she noted\\n\\nthat the cook conversed with the chief in the language of the Negro.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat a remarkable man the fellow was, indeed! She had thought him\\n\\nignorant and stupid but a short day before, and now, within the past\\n\\ntwenty-four hours, she had learned that he spoke not only English but\\n\\nFrench as well, and the primitive dialect of the West Coast.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe had thought him shifty, cruel, and untrustworthy, yet in so far as\\n\\nshe had reason to believe he had proved himself in every way the\\n\\ncontrary since the day before. It scarce seemed credible that he could\\n\\nbe serving her from motives purely chivalrous. There must be something\\n\\ndeeper in his intentions and plans than he had yet disclosed.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe wondered, and when she looked at him—at his close-set, shifty eyes\\n\\nand repulsive features, she shuddered, for she was convinced that no\\n\\nlofty characteristics could be hid behind so foul an exterior.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs she was thinking of these things the while she debated the wisdom of\\n\\nuncovering the baby’s face, there came a little grunt from the wee\\n\\nbundle in her lap, and then a gurgling coo that set her heart in\\n\\nraptures.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe baby was awake! Now she might feast her eyes upon him.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuickly she snatched the blanket from before the infant’s face;\\n\\nAnderssen was looking at her as she did so.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe saw her stagger to her feet, holding the baby at arm’s length from\\n\\nher, her eyes glued in horror upon the little chubby face and twinkling\\n\\neyes.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen he heard her piteous cry as her knees gave beneath her, and she\\n\\nsank to the ground in a swoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\n\\nThe Swede\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the warriors, clustered thick about Tarzan and Sheeta, realized that\\n\\nit was a flesh-and-blood panther that had interrupted their dance of\\n\\ndeath, they took heart a trifle, for in the face of all those circling\\n\\nspears even the mighty Sheeta would be doomed.\\n\\n\\n\\nRokoff was urging the chief to have his spearmen launch their missiles,\\n\\nand the black was upon the instant of issuing the command, when his\\n\\neyes strayed beyond Tarzan, following the gaze of the ape-man.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a yell of terror the chief turned and fled toward the village\\n\\ngate, and as his people looked to see the cause of his fright, they too\\n\\ntook to their heels—for there, lumbering down upon them, their huge\\n\\nforms exaggerated by the play of moonlight and camp fire, came the\\n\\nhideous apes of Akut.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe instant the natives turned to flee the ape-man’s savage cry rang\\n\\nout above the shrieks of the blacks, and in answer to it Sheeta and the\\n\\napes leaped growling after the fugitives. Some of the warriors turned\\n\\nto battle with their enraged antagonists, but before the fiendish\\n\\nferocity of the fierce beasts they went down to bloody death.\\n\\n\\n\\nOthers were dragged down in their flight, and it was not until the\\n\\nvillage was empty and the last of the blacks had disappeared into the\\n\\nbush that Tarzan was able to recall his savage pack to his side. Then\\n\\nit was that he discovered to his chagrin that he could not make one of\\n\\nthem, not even the comparatively intelligent Akut, understand that he\\n\\nwished to be freed from the bonds that held him to the stake.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn time, of course, the idea would filter through their thick skulls,\\n\\nbut in the meanwhile many things might happen—the blacks might return\\n\\nin force to regain their village; the whites might readily pick them\\n\\nall off with their rifles from the surrounding trees; he might even\\n\\nstarve to death before the dull-witted apes realized that he wished\\n\\nthem to gnaw through his bonds.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs for Sheeta—the great cat understood even less than the apes; but yet\\n\\nTarzan could not but marvel at the remarkable characteristics this\\n\\nbeast had evidenced. That it felt real affection for him there seemed\\n\\nlittle doubt, for now that the blacks were disposed of it walked slowly\\n\\nback and forth about the stake, rubbing its sides against the ape-man’s\\n\\nlegs and purring like a contented tabby. That it had gone of its own\\n\\nvolition to bring the balance of the pack to his rescue, Tarzan could\\n\\nnot doubt. His Sheeta was indeed a jewel among beasts.\\n\\n\\n\\nMugambi’s absence worried the ape-man not a little. He attempted to\\n\\nlearn from Akut what had become of the black, fearing that the beasts,\\n\\nfreed from the restraint of Tarzan’s presence, might have fallen upon\\n\\nthe man and devoured him; but to all his questions the great ape but\\n\\npointed back in the direction from which they had come out of the\\n\\njungle.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe night passed with Tarzan still fast bound to the stake, and shortly\\n\\nafter dawn his fears were realized in the discovery of naked black\\n\\nfigures moving stealthily just within the edge of the jungle about the\\n\\nvillage. The blacks were returning.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith daylight their courage would be equal to the demands of a charge\\n\\nupon the handful of beasts that had routed them from their rightful\\n\\nabodes. The result of the encounter seemed foregone if the savages\\n\\ncould curb their superstitious terror, for against their overwhelming\\n\\nnumbers, their long spears and poisoned arrows, the panther and the\\n\\napes could not be expected to survive a really determined attack.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat the blacks were preparing for a charge became apparent a few\\n\\nmoments later, when they commenced to show themselves in force upon the\\n\\nedge of the clearing, dancing and jumping about as they waved their\\n\\nspears and shouted taunts and fierce warcries toward the village.\\n\\n\\n\\nThese manoeuvres Tarzan knew would continue until the blacks had worked\\n\\nthemselves into a state of hysterical courage sufficient to sustain\\n\\nthem for a short charge toward the village, and even though he doubted\\n\\nthat they would reach it at the first attempt, he believed that at the\\n\\nsecond or the third they would swarm through the gateway, when the\\n\\noutcome could not be aught than the extermination of Tarzan’s bold, but\\n\\nunarmed and undisciplined, defenders.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven as he had guessed, the first charge carried the howling warriors\\n\\nbut a short distance into the open—a shrill, weird challenge from the\\n\\nape-man being all that was necessary to send them scurrying back to the\\n\\nbush. For half an hour they pranced and yelled their courage to the\\n\\nsticking-point, and again essayed a charge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis time they came quite to the village gate, but when Sheeta and the\\n\\nhideous apes leaped among them they turned screaming in terror, and\\n\\nagain fled to the jungle.\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain was the dancing and shouting repeated. This time Tarzan felt no\\n\\ndoubt they would enter the village and complete the work that a handful\\n\\nof determined white men would have carried to a successful conclusion\\n\\nat the first attempt.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo have rescue come so close only to be thwarted because he could not\\n\\nmake his poor, savage friends understand precisely what he wanted of\\n\\nthem was most irritating, but he could not find it in his heart to\\n\\nplace blame upon them. They had done their best, and now he was sure\\n\\nthey would doubtless remain to die with him in a fruitless effort to\\n\\ndefend him.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe blacks were already preparing for the charge. A few individuals had\\n\\nadvanced a short distance toward the village and were exhorting the\\n\\nothers to follow them. In a moment the whole savage horde would be\\n\\nracing across the clearing.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan thought only of the little child somewhere in this cruel,\\n\\nrelentless wilderness. His heart ached for the son that he might no\\n\\nlonger seek to save—that and the realization of Jane’s suffering were\\n\\nall that weighed upon his brave spirit in these that he thought his\\n\\nlast moments of life. Succour, all that he could hope for, had come to\\n\\nhim in the instant of his extremity—and failed. There was nothing\\n\\nfurther for which to hope.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe blacks were half-way across the clearing when Tarzan’s attention\\n\\nwas attracted by the actions of one of the apes. The beast was glaring\\n\\ntoward one of the huts. Tarzan followed his gaze. To his infinite\\n\\nrelief and delight he saw the stalwart form of Mugambi racing toward\\n\\nhim.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe huge black was panting heavily as though from strenuous physical\\n\\nexertion and nervous excitement. He rushed to Tarzan’s side, and as the\\n\\nfirst of the savages reached the village gate the native’s knife\\n\\nsevered the last of the cords that bound Tarzan to the stake.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the street lay the corpses of the savages that had fallen before the\\n\\npack the night before. From one of these Tarzan seized a spear and knob\\n\\nstick, and with Mugambi at his side and the snarling pack about him, he\\n\\nmet the natives as they poured through the gate.\\n\\n\\n\\nFierce and terrible was the battle that ensued, but at last the savages\\n\\nwere routed, more by terror, perhaps, at sight of a black man and a\\n\\nwhite fighting in company with a panther and the huge fierce apes of\\n\\nAkut, than because of their inability to overcome the relatively small\\n\\nforce that opposed them.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne prisoner fell into the hands of Tarzan, and him the ape-man\\n\\nquestioned in an effort to learn what had become of Rokoff and his\\n\\nparty. Promised his liberty in return for the information, the black\\n\\ntold all he knew concerning the movements of the Russian.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt seemed that early in the morning their chief had attempted to\\n\\nprevail upon the whites to return with him to the village and with\\n\\ntheir guns destroy the ferocious pack that had taken possession of it,\\n\\nbut Rokoff appeared to entertain even more fears of the giant white man\\n\\nand his strange companions than even the blacks themselves.\\n\\n\\n\\nUpon no conditions would he consent to returning even within sight of\\n\\nthe village. Instead, he took his party hurriedly to the river, where\\n\\nthey stole a number of canoes the blacks had hidden there. The last\\n\\nthat had been seen of them they had been paddling strongly up-stream,\\n\\ntheir porters from Kaviri’s village wielding the blades.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo once more Tarzan of the Apes with his hideous pack took up his\\n\\nsearch for the ape-man’s son and the pursuit of his abductor.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor weary days they followed through an almost uninhabited country,\\n\\nonly to learn at last that they were upon the wrong trail. The little\\n\\nband had been reduced by three, for three of Akut’s apes had fallen in\\n\\nthe fighting at the village. Now, with Akut, there were five great\\n\\napes, and Sheeta was there—and Mugambi and Tarzan.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ape-man no longer heard rumors even of the three who had preceded\\n\\nRokoff—the white man and woman and the child. Who the man and woman\\n\\nwere he could not guess, but that the child was his was enough to keep\\n\\nhim hot upon the trail. He was sure that Rokoff would be following this\\n\\ntrio, and so he felt confident that so long as he could keep upon the\\n\\nRussian’s trail he would be winning so much nearer to the time he might\\n\\nsnatch his son from the dangers and horrors that menaced him.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn retracing their way after losing Rokoff’s trail Tarzan picked it up\\n\\nagain at a point where the Russian had left the river and taken to the\\n\\nbrush in a northerly direction. He could only account for this change\\n\\non the ground that the child had been carried away from the river by\\n\\nthe two who now had possession of it.\\n\\n\\n\\nNowhere along the way, however, could he gain definite information that\\n\\nmight assure him positively that the child was ahead of him. Not a\\n\\nsingle native they questioned had seen or heard of this other party,\\n\\nthough nearly all had had direct experience with the Russian or had\\n\\ntalked with others who had.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was with difficulty that Tarzan could find means to communicate with\\n\\nthe natives, as the moment their eyes fell upon his companions they\\n\\nfled precipitately into the bush. His only alternative was to go ahead\\n\\nof his pack and waylay an occasional warrior whom he found alone in the\\n\\njungle.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne day as he was thus engaged, tracking an unsuspecting savage, he\\n\\ncame upon the fellow in the act of hurling a spear at a wounded white\\n\\nman who crouched in a clump of bush at the trail’s side. The white was\\n\\none whom Tarzan had often seen, and whom he recognized at once.\\n\\n\\n\\nDeep in his memory was implanted those repulsive features—the close-set\\n\\neyes, the shifty expression, the drooping yellow moustache.\\n\\n\\n\\nInstantly it occurred to the ape-man that this fellow had not been\\n\\namong those who had accompanied Rokoff at the village where Tarzan had\\n\\nbeen a prisoner. He had seen them all, and this fellow had not been\\n\\nthere. There could be but one explanation—he it was who had fled ahead\\n\\nof the Russian with the woman and the child—and the woman had been Jane\\n\\nClayton. He was sure now of the meaning of Rokoff’s words.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ape-man’s face went white as he looked upon the pasty, vice-marked\\n\\ncountenance of the Swede. Across Tarzan’s forehead stood out the broad\\n\\nband of scarlet that marked the scar where, years before, Terkoz had\\n\\ntorn a great strip of the ape-man’s scalp from his skull in the fierce\\n\\nbattle in which Tarzan had sustained his fitness to the kingship of the\\n\\napes of Kerchak.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe man was his prey—the black should not have him, and with the\\n\\nthought he leaped upon the warrior, striking down the spear before it\\n\\ncould reach its mark. The black, whipping out his knife, turned to do\\n\\nbattle with this new enemy, while the Swede, lying in the bush,\\n\\nwitnessed a duel, the like of which he had never dreamed to see—a\\n\\nhalf-naked white man battling with a half-naked black, hand to hand\\n\\nwith the crude weapons of primeval man at first, and then with hands\\n\\nand teeth like the primordial brutes from whose loins their forebears\\n\\nsprung.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a time Anderssen did not recognize the white, and when at last it\\n\\ndawned upon him that he had seen this giant before, his eyes went wide\\n\\nin surprise that this growling, rending beast could ever have been the\\n\\nwell-groomed English gentleman who had been a prisoner aboard the\\n\\nKincaid.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn English nobleman! He had learned the identity of the Kincaid’s\\n\\nprisoners from Lady Greystoke during their flight up the Ugambi.\\n\\nBefore, in common with the other members of the crew of the steamer, he\\n\\nhad not known who the two might be.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fight was over. Tarzan had been compelled to kill his antagonist,\\n\\nas the fellow would not surrender.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Swede saw the white man leap to his feet beside the corpse of his\\n\\nfoe, and placing one foot upon the broken neck lift his voice in the\\n\\nhideous challenge of the victorious bull-ape.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnderssen shuddered. Then Tarzan turned toward him. His face was cold\\n\\nand cruel, and in the grey eyes the Swede read murder.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Where is my wife?” growled the ape-man. “Where is the child?”\\n\\n\\n\\nAnderssen tried to reply, but a sudden fit of coughing choked him.\\n\\nThere was an arrow entirely through his chest, and as he coughed the\\n\\nblood from his wounded lung poured suddenly from his mouth and\\n\\nnostrils.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan stood waiting for the paroxysm to pass. Like a bronze\\n\\nimage—cold, hard, and relentless—he stood over the helpless man,\\n\\nwaiting to wring such information from him as he needed, and then to\\n\\nkill.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently the coughing and haemorrhage ceased, and again the wounded\\n\\nman tried to speak. Tarzan knelt near the faintly moving lips.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The wife and child!” he repeated. “Where are they?”\\n\\n\\n\\nAnderssen pointed up the trail.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The Russian—he got them,” he whispered.\\n\\n\\n\\n“How did you come here?” continued Tarzan. “Why are you not with\\n\\nRokoff?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“They catch us,” replied Anderssen, in a voice so low that the ape-man\\n\\ncould just distinguish the words. “They catch us. Ay fight, but my men\\n\\nthey all run away. Then they get me when Ay ban vounded. Rokoff he say\\n\\nleave me here for the hyenas. That vas vorse than to kill. He tak your\\n\\nvife and kid.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What were you doing with them—where were you taking them?” asked\\n\\nTarzan, and then fiercely, leaping close to the fellow with fierce eyes\\n\\nblazing with the passion of hate and vengeance that he had with\\n\\ndifficulty controlled, “What harm did you do to my wife or child? Speak\\n\\nquick before I kill you! Make your peace with God! Tell me the worst,\\n\\nor I will tear you to pieces with my hands and teeth. You have seen\\n\\nthat I can do it!”\\n\\n\\n\\nA look of wide-eyed surprise overspread Anderssen’s face.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why,” he whispered, “Ay did not hurt them. Ay tried to save them from\\n\\nthat Russian. Your vife was kind to me on the Kincaid, and Ay hear that\\n\\nlittle baby cry sometimes. Ay got a vife an’ kid for my own by\\n\\nChristiania an’ Ay couldn’t bear for to see them separated an’ in\\n\\nRokoff’s hands any more. That vas all. Do Ay look like Ay ban here to\\n\\nhurt them?” he continued after a pause, pointing to the arrow\\n\\nprotruding from his breast.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was something in the man’s tone and expression that convinced\\n\\nTarzan of the truth of his assertions. More weighty than anything else\\n\\nwas the fact that Anderssen evidently seemed more hurt than frightened.\\n\\nHe knew he was going to die, so Tarzan’s threats had little effect upon\\n\\nhim; but it was quite apparent that he wished the Englishman to know\\n\\nthe truth and not to wrong him by harbouring the belief that his words\\n\\nand manner indicated that he had entertained.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ape-man instantly dropped to his knees beside the Swede.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I am sorry,” he said very simply. “I had looked for none but knaves in\\n\\ncompany with Rokoff. I see that I was wrong. That is past now, and we\\n\\nwill drop it for the more important matter of getting you to a place of\\n\\ncomfort and looking after your wounds. We must have you on your feet\\n\\nagain as soon as possible.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Swede, smiling, shook his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You go on an’ look for the vife an’ kid,” he said. “Ay ban as gude as\\n\\ndead already; but”—he hesitated—“Ay hate to think of the hyenas. Von’t\\n\\nyou finish up this job?”\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan shuddered. A moment ago he had been upon the point of killing\\n\\nthis man. Now he could no more have taken his life than he could have\\n\\ntaken the life of any of his best friends.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe lifted the Swede’s head in his arms to change and ease his position.\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain came a fit of coughing and the terrible haemorrhage. After it was\\n\\nover Anderssen lay with closed eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan thought that he was dead, until he suddenly raised his eyes to\\n\\nthose of the ape-man, sighed, and spoke—in a very low, weak whisper.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ay tank it blow purty soon purty hard!” he said, and died.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\nTambudza\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan scooped a shallow grave for the Kincaid’s cook, beneath whose\\n\\nrepulsive exterior had beaten the heart of a chivalrous gentleman. That\\n\\nwas all he could do in the cruel jungle for the man who had given his\\n\\nlife in the service of his little son and his wife.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen Tarzan took up again the pursuit of Rokoff. Now that he was\\n\\npositive that the woman ahead of him was indeed Jane, and that she had\\n\\nagain fallen into the hands of the Russian, it seemed that with all the\\n\\nincredible speed of his fleet and agile muscles he moved at but a\\n\\nsnail’s pace.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was with difficulty that he kept the trail, for there were many\\n\\npaths through the jungle at this point—crossing and crisscrossing,\\n\\nforking and branching in all directions, and over them all had passed\\n\\nnatives innumerable, coming and going. The spoor of the white men was\\n\\nobliterated by that of the native carriers who had followed them, and\\n\\nover all was the spoor of other natives and of wild beasts.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was most perplexing; yet Tarzan kept on assiduously, checking his\\n\\nsense of sight against his sense of smell, that he might more surely\\n\\nkeep to the right trail. But, with all his care, night found him at a\\n\\npoint where he was positive that he was on the wrong trail entirely.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe knew that the pack would follow his spoor, and so he had been\\n\\ncareful to make it as distinct as possible, brushing often against the\\n\\nvines and creepers that walled the jungle-path, and in other ways\\n\\nleaving his scent-spoor plainly discernible.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs darkness settled a heavy rain set in, and there was nothing for the\\n\\nbaffled ape-man to do but wait in the partial shelter of a huge tree\\n\\nuntil morning; but the coming of dawn brought no cessation of the\\n\\ntorrential downpour.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a week the sun was obscured by heavy clouds, while violent rain and\\n\\nwind storms obliterated the last remnants of the spoor Tarzan\\n\\nconstantly though vainly sought.\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring all this time he saw no signs of natives, nor of his own pack,\\n\\nthe members of which he feared had lost his trail during the terrific\\n\\nstorm. As the country was strange to him, he had been unable to judge\\n\\nhis course accurately, since he had had neither sun by day nor moon nor\\n\\nstars by night to guide him.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the sun at last broke through the clouds in the fore-noon of the\\n\\nseventh day, it looked down upon an almost frantic ape-man.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the first time in his life, Tarzan of the Apes had been lost in the\\n\\njungle. That the experience should have befallen him at such a time\\n\\nseemed cruel beyond expression. Somewhere in this savage land his wife\\n\\nand son lay in the clutches of the arch-fiend Rokoff.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat hideous trials might they not have undergone during those seven\\n\\nawful days that nature had thwarted him in his endeavours to locate\\n\\nthem? Tarzan knew the Russian, in whose power they were, so well that\\n\\nhe could not doubt but that the man, filled with rage that Jane had\\n\\nonce escaped him, and knowing that Tarzan might be close upon his\\n\\ntrail, would wreak without further loss of time whatever vengeance his\\n\\npolluted mind might be able to conceive.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut now that the sun shone once more, the ape-man was still at a loss\\n\\nas to what direction to take. He knew that Rokoff had left the river in\\n\\npursuit of Anderssen, but whether he would continue inland or return to\\n\\nthe Ugambi was a question.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ape-man had seen that the river at the point he had left it was\\n\\ngrowing narrow and swift, so that he judged that it could not be\\n\\nnavigable even for canoes to any great distance farther toward its\\n\\nsource. However, if Rokoff had not returned to the river, in what\\n\\ndirection had he proceeded?\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom the direction of Anderssen’s flight with Jane and the child Tarzan\\n\\nwas convinced that the man had purposed attempting the tremendous feat\\n\\nof crossing the continent to Zanzibar; but whether Rokoff would dare so\\n\\ndangerous a journey or not was a question.\\n\\n\\n\\nFear might drive him to the attempt now that he knew the manner of\\n\\nhorrible pack that was upon his trail, and that Tarzan of the Apes was\\n\\nfollowing him to wreak upon him the vengeance that he deserved.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt last the ape-man determined to continue toward the northeast in the\\n\\ngeneral direction of German East Africa until he came upon natives from\\n\\nwhom he might gain information as to Rokoff’s whereabouts.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe second day following the cessation of the rain Tarzan came upon a\\n\\nnative village the inhabitants of which fled into the bush the instant\\n\\ntheir eyes fell upon him. Tarzan, not to be thwarted in any such manner\\n\\nas this, pursued them, and after a brief chase caught up with a young\\n\\nwarrior. The fellow was so badly frightened that he was unable to\\n\\ndefend himself, dropping his weapons and falling upon the ground,\\n\\nwide-eyed and screaming as he gazed on his captor.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was with considerable difficulty that the ape-man quieted the\\n\\nfellow’s fears sufficiently to obtain a coherent statement from him as\\n\\nto the cause of his uncalled-for terror.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom him Tarzan learned, by dint of much coaxing, that a party of\\n\\nwhites had passed through the village several days before. These men\\n\\nhad told them of a terrible white devil that pursued them, warning the\\n\\nnatives against it and the frightful pack of demons that accompanied\\n\\nit.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe black had recognized Tarzan as the white devil from the\\n\\ndescriptions given by the whites and their black servants. Behind him\\n\\nhe had expected to see a horde of demons disguised as apes and\\n\\npanthers.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this Tarzan saw the cunning hand of Rokoff. The Russian was\\n\\nattempting to make travel as difficult as possible for him by turning\\n\\nthe natives against him in superstitious fear.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe native further told Tarzan that the white man who had led the\\n\\nrecent expedition had promised them a fabulous reward if they would\\n\\nkill the white devil. This they had fully intended doing should the\\n\\nopportunity present itself; but the moment they had seen Tarzan their\\n\\nblood had turned to water, as the porters of the white men had told\\n\\nthem would be the case.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinding the ape-man made no attempt to harm him, the native at last\\n\\nrecovered his grasp upon his courage, and, at Tarzan’s suggestion,\\n\\naccompanied the white devil back to the village, calling as he went for\\n\\nhis fellows to return also, as “the white devil has promised to do you\\n\\nno harm if you come back right away and answer his questions.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOne by one the blacks straggled into the village, but that their fears\\n\\nwere not entirely allayed was evident from the amount of white that\\n\\nshowed about the eyes of the majority of them as they cast constant and\\n\\napprehensive sidelong glances at the ape-man.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe chief was among the first to return to the village, and as it was\\n\\nhe that Tarzan was most anxious to interview, he lost no time in\\n\\nentering into a palaver with the black.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fellow was short and stout, with an unusually low and degraded\\n\\ncountenance and apelike arms. His whole expression denoted\\n\\ndeceitfulness.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnly the superstitious terror engendered in him by the stories poured\\n\\ninto his ears by the whites and blacks of the Russian’s party kept him\\n\\nfrom leaping upon Tarzan with his warriors and slaying him forthwith,\\n\\nfor he and his people were inveterate maneaters. But the fear that he\\n\\nmight indeed be a devil, and that out there in the jungle behind him\\n\\nhis fierce demons waited to do his bidding, kept M’ganwazam from\\n\\nputting his desires into action.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan questioned the fellow closely, and by comparing his statements\\n\\nwith those of the young warrior he had first talked with he learned\\n\\nthat Rokoff and his safari were in terror-stricken retreat in the\\n\\ndirection of the far East Coast.\\n\\n\\n\\nMany of the Russian’s porters had already deserted him. In that very\\n\\nvillage he had hanged five for theft and attempted desertion. Judging,\\n\\nhowever, from what the Waganwazam had learned from those of the\\n\\nRussian’s blacks who were not too far gone in terror of the brutal\\n\\nRokoff to fear even to speak of their plans, it was apparent that he\\n\\nwould not travel any great distance before the last of his porters,\\n\\ncooks, tent-boys, gun-bearers, askari, and even his headman, would have\\n\\nturned back into the bush, leaving him to the mercy of the merciless\\n\\njungle.\\n\\n\\n\\nM’ganwazam denied that there had been any white woman or child with the\\n\\nparty of whites; but even as he spoke Tarzan was convinced that he\\n\\nlied. Several times the ape-man approached the subject from different\\n\\nangles, but never was he successful in surprising the wily cannibal\\n\\ninto a direct contradiction of his original statement that there had\\n\\nbeen no women or children with the party.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan demanded food of the chief, and after considerable haggling on\\n\\nthe part of the monarch succeeded in obtaining a meal. He then tried to\\n\\ndraw out others of the tribe, especially the young man whom he had\\n\\ncaptured in the bush, but M’ganwazam’s presence sealed their lips.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt last, convinced that these people knew a great deal more than they\\n\\nhad told him concerning the whereabouts of the Russian and the fate of\\n\\nJane and the child, Tarzan determined to remain overnight among them in\\n\\nthe hope of discovering something further of importance.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen he had stated his decision to the chief he was rather surprised to\\n\\nnote the sudden change in the fellow’s attitude toward him. From\\n\\napparent dislike and suspicion M’ganwazam became a most eager and\\n\\nsolicitous host.\\n\\n\\n\\nNothing would do but that the ape-man should occupy the best hut in the\\n\\nvillage, from which M’ganwazam’s oldest wife was forthwith summarily\\n\\nejected, while the chief took up his temporary abode in the hut of one\\n\\nof his younger consorts.\\n\\n\\n\\nHad Tarzan chanced to recall the fact that a princely reward had been\\n\\noffered the blacks if they should succeed in killing him, he might have\\n\\nmore quickly interpreted M’ganwazam’s sudden change in front.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo have the white giant sleeping peacefully in one of his own huts\\n\\nwould greatly facilitate the matter of earning the reward, and so the\\n\\nchief was urgent in his suggestions that Tarzan, doubtless being very\\n\\nmuch fatigued after his travels, should retire early to the comforts of\\n\\nthe anything but inviting palace.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs much as the ape-man detested the thought of sleeping within a native\\n\\nhut, he had determined to do so this night, on the chance that he might\\n\\nbe able to induce one of the younger men to sit and chat with him\\n\\nbefore the fire that burned in the centre of the smoke-filled dwelling,\\n\\nand from him draw the truths he sought. So Tarzan accepted the\\n\\ninvitation of old M’ganwazam, insisting, however, that he much\\n\\npreferred sharing a hut with some of the younger men rather than\\n\\ndriving the chief’s old wife out in the cold.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe toothless old hag grinned her appreciation of this suggestion, and\\n\\nas the plan still better suited the chief’s scheme, in that it would\\n\\npermit him to surround Tarzan with a gang of picked assassins, he\\n\\nreadily assented, so that presently Tarzan had been installed in a hut\\n\\nclose to the village gate.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs there was to be a dance that night in honour of a band of recently\\n\\nreturned hunters, Tarzan was left alone in the hut, the young men, as\\n\\nM’ganwazam explained, having to take part in the festivities.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs soon as the ape-man was safely installed in the trap, M’Ganwazam\\n\\ncalled about him the young warriors whom he had selected to spend the\\n\\nnight with the white devil!\\n\\n\\n\\nNone of them was overly enthusiastic about the plan, since deep in\\n\\ntheir superstitious hearts lay an exaggerated fear of the strange white\\n\\ngiant; but the word of M’ganwazam was law among his people, so not one\\n\\ndared refuse the duty he was called upon to perform.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs M’ganwazam unfolded his plan in whispers to the savages squatting\\n\\nabout him the old, toothless hag, to whom Tarzan had saved her hut for\\n\\nthe night, hovered about the conspirators ostensibly to replenish the\\n\\nsupply of firewood for the blaze about which the men sat, but really to\\n\\ndrink in as much of their conversation as possible.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan had slept for perhaps an hour or two despite the savage din of\\n\\nthe revellers when his keen senses came suddenly alert to a\\n\\nsuspiciously stealthy movement in the hut in which he lay. The fire had\\n\\ndied down to a little heap of glowing embers, which accentuated rather\\n\\nthan relieved the darkness that shrouded the interior of the\\n\\nevil-smelling dwelling, yet the trained senses of the ape-man warned\\n\\nhim of another presence creeping almost silently toward him through the\\n\\ngloom.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe doubted that it was one of his hut mates returning from the\\n\\nfestivities, for he still heard the wild cries of the dancers and the\\n\\ndin of the tom-toms in the village street without. Who could it be that\\n\\ntook such pains to conceal his approach?\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the presence came within reach of him the ape-man bounded lightly to\\n\\nthe opposite side of the hut, his spear poised ready at his side.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Who is it,” he asked, “that creeps upon Tarzan of the Apes, like a\\n\\nhungry lion out of the darkness?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Silence, bwana!” replied an old cracked voice. “It is Tambudza—she\\n\\nwhose hut you would not take, and thus drive an old woman out into the\\n\\ncold night.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What does Tambudza want of Tarzan of the Apes?” asked the ape-man.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You were kind to me to whom none is now kind, and I have come to warn\\n\\nyou in payment of your kindness,” answered the old hag.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Warn me of what?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“M’ganwazam has chosen the young men who are to sleep in the hut with\\n\\nyou,” replied Tambudza. “I was near as he talked with them, and heard\\n\\nhim issuing his instructions to them. When the dance is run well into\\n\\nthe morning they are to come to the hut.\\n\\n\\n\\n“If you are awake they are to pretend that they have come to sleep, but\\n\\nif you sleep it is M’ganwazam’s command that you be killed. If you are\\n\\nnot then asleep they will wait quietly beside you until you do sleep,\\n\\nand then they will all fall upon you together and slay you. M’ganwazam\\n\\nis determined to win the reward the white man has offered.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I had forgotten the reward,” said Tarzan, half to himself, and then he\\n\\nadded, “How may M’ganwazam hope to collect the reward now that the\\n\\nwhite men who are my enemies have left his country and gone he knows\\n\\nnot where?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, they have not gone far,” replied Tambudza. “M’ganwazam knows where\\n\\nthey camp. His runners could quickly overtake them—they move slowly.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Where are they?” asked Tarzan.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do you wish to come to them?” asked Tambudza in way of reply.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I cannot tell you where they lie so that you could come to the place\\n\\nyourself, but I could lead you to them, bwana.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIn their interest in the conversation neither of the speakers had\\n\\nnoticed the little figure which crept into the darkness of the hut\\n\\nbehind them, nor did they see it when it slunk noiselessly out again.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was little Buulaoo, the chief’s son by one of his younger wives—a\\n\\nvindictive, degenerate little rascal who hated Tambudza, and was ever\\n\\nseeking opportunities to spy upon her and report her slightest breach\\n\\nof custom to his father.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come, then,” said Tarzan quickly, “let us be on our way.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThis Buulaoo did not hear, for he was already legging it up the village\\n\\nstreet to where his hideous sire guzzled native beer, and watched the\\n\\nevolutions of the frantic dancers leaping high in the air and cavorting\\n\\nwildly in their hysterical capers.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo it happened that as Tarzan and Tambudza sneaked warily from the\\n\\nvillage and melted into the Stygian darkness of the jungle two lithe\\n\\nrunners took their way in the same direction, though by another trail.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen they had come sufficiently far from the village to make it safe\\n\\nfor them to speak above a whisper, Tarzan asked the old woman if she\\n\\nhad seen aught of a white woman and a little child.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, bwana,” replied Tambudza, “there was a woman with them and a\\n\\nlittle child—a little white piccaninny. It died here in our village of\\n\\nthe fever and they buried it!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\n\\nA Black Scoundrel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Jane Clayton regained consciousness she saw Anderssen standing\\n\\nover her, holding the baby in his arms. As her eyes rested upon them an\\n\\nexpression of misery and horror overspread her countenance.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What is the matter?” he asked. “You ban sick?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Where is my baby?” she cried, ignoring his questions.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnderssen held out the chubby infant, but she shook her head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is not mine,” she said. “You knew that it was not mine. You are a\\n\\ndevil like the Russian.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAnderssen’s blue eyes stretched in surprise.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not yours!” he exclaimed. “You tole me the kid aboard the Kincaid ban\\n\\nyour kid.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not this one,” replied Jane dully. “The other. Where is the other?\\n\\nThere must have been two. I did not know about this one.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“There vasn’t no other kid. Ay tank this ban yours. Ay am very sorry.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAnderssen fidgeted about, standing first on one foot and then upon the\\n\\nother. It was perfectly evident to Jane that he was honest in his\\n\\nprotestations of ignorance of the true identity of the child.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently the baby commenced to crow, and bounce up and down in the\\n\\nSwede’s arms, at the same time leaning forward with little hands\\n\\nout-reaching toward the young woman.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe could not withstand the appeal, and with a low cry she sprang to\\n\\nher feet and gathered the baby to her breast.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a few minutes she wept silently, her face buried in the baby’s\\n\\nsoiled little dress. The first shock of disappointment that the tiny\\n\\nthing had not been her beloved Jack was giving way to a great hope that\\n\\nafter all some miracle had occurred to snatch her baby from Rokoff’s\\n\\nhands at the last instant before the Kincaid sailed from England.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen, too, there was the mute appeal of this wee waif alone and unloved\\n\\nin the midst of the horrors of the savage jungle. It was this thought\\n\\nmore than any other that had sent her mother’s heart out to the\\n\\ninnocent babe, while still she suffered from disappointment that she\\n\\nhad been deceived in its identity.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Have you no idea whose child this is?” she asked Anderssen.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe man shook his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not now,” he said. “If he ain’t ban your kid, Ay don’ know whose kid\\n\\nhe do ban. Rokoff said it was yours. Ay tank he tank so, too.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What do we do with it now? Ay can’t go back to the Kincaid. Rokoff\\n\\nwould have me shot; but you can go back. Ay take you to the sea, and\\n\\nthen some of these black men they take you to the ship—eh?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No! no!” cried Jane. “Not for the world. I would rather die than fall\\n\\ninto the hands of that man again. No, let us go on and take this poor\\n\\nlittle creature with us. If God is willing we shall be saved in one way\\n\\nor another.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSo they again took up their flight through the wilderness, taking with\\n\\nthem a half-dozen of the Mosulas to carry provisions and the tents that\\n\\nAnderssen had smuggled aboard the small boat in preparation for the\\n\\nattempted escape.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe days and nights of torture that the young woman suffered were so\\n\\nmerged into one long, unbroken nightmare of hideousness that she soon\\n\\nlost all track of time. Whether they had been wandering for days or\\n\\nyears she could not tell. The one bright spot in that eternity of fear\\n\\nand suffering was the little child whose tiny hands had long since\\n\\nfastened their softly groping fingers firmly about her heart.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a way the little thing took the place and filled the aching void\\n\\nthat the theft of her own baby had left. It could never be the same, of\\n\\ncourse, but yet, day by day, she found her mother-love, enveloping the\\n\\nwaif more closely until she sometimes sat with closed eyes lost in the\\n\\nsweet imagining that the little bundle of humanity at her breast was\\n\\ntruly her own.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor some time their progress inland was extremely slow. Word came to\\n\\nthem from time to time through natives passing from the coast on\\n\\nhunting excursions that Rokoff had not yet guessed the direction of\\n\\ntheir flight. This, and the desire to make the journey as light as\\n\\npossible for the gently bred woman, kept Anderssen to a slow advance of\\n\\nshort and easy marches with many rests.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Swede insisted upon carrying the child while they travelled, and in\\n\\ncountless other ways did what he could to help Jane Clayton conserve\\n\\nher strength. He had been terribly chagrined on discovering the mistake\\n\\nhe had made in the identity of the baby, but once the young woman\\n\\nbecame convinced that his motives were truly chivalrous she would not\\n\\npermit him longer to upbraid himself for the error that he could not by\\n\\nany means have avoided.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the close of each day’s march Anderssen saw to the erection of a\\n\\ncomfortable shelter for Jane and the child. Her tent was always pitched\\n\\nin the most favourable location. The thorn boma round it was the\\n\\nstrongest and most impregnable that the Mosula could construct.\\n\\n\\n\\nHer food was the best that their limited stores and the rifle of the\\n\\nSwede could provide, but the thing that touched her heart the closest\\n\\nwas the gentle consideration and courtesy which the man always accorded\\n\\nher.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat such nobility of character could lie beneath so repulsive an\\n\\nexterior never ceased to be a source of wonder and amazement to her,\\n\\nuntil at last the innate chivalry of the man, and his unfailing\\n\\nkindliness and sympathy transformed his appearance in so far as Jane\\n\\nwas concerned until she saw only the sweetness of his character\\n\\nmirrored in his countenance.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey had commenced to make a little better progress when word reached\\n\\nthem that Rokoff was but a few marches behind them, and that he had at\\n\\nlast discovered the direction of their flight. It was then that\\n\\nAnderssen took to the river, purchasing a canoe from a chief whose\\n\\nvillage lay a short distance from the Ugambi upon the bank of a\\n\\ntributary.\\n\\n\\n\\nThereafter the little party of fugitives fled up the broad Ugambi, and\\n\\nso rapid had their flight become that they no longer received word of\\n\\ntheir pursuers. At the end of canoe navigation upon the river, they\\n\\nabandoned their canoe and took to the jungle. Here progress became at\\n\\nonce arduous, slow, and dangerous.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe second day after leaving the Ugambi the baby fell ill with fever.\\n\\nAnderssen knew what the outcome must be, but he had not the heart to\\n\\ntell Jane Clayton the truth, for he had seen that the young woman had\\n\\ncome to love the child almost as passionately as though it had been her\\n\\nown flesh and blood.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the baby’s condition precluded farther advance, Anderssen withdrew a\\n\\nlittle from the main trail he had been following and built a camp in a\\n\\nnatural clearing on the bank of a little river.\\n\\n\\n\\nHere Jane devoted her every moment to caring for the tiny sufferer, and\\n\\nas though her sorrow and anxiety were not all that she could bear, a\\n\\nfurther blow came with the sudden announcement of one of the Mosula\\n\\nporters who had been foraging in the jungle adjacent that Rokoff and\\n\\nhis party were camped quite close to them, and were evidently upon\\n\\ntheir trail to this little nook which all had thought so excellent a\\n\\nhiding-place.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis information could mean but one thing, and that they must break\\n\\ncamp and fly onward regardless of the baby’s condition. Jane Clayton\\n\\nknew the traits of the Russian well enough to be positive that he would\\n\\nseparate her from the child the moment that he recaptured them, and she\\n\\nknew that separation would mean the immediate death of the baby.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs they stumbled forward through the tangled vegetation along an old\\n\\nand almost overgrown game trail the Mosula porters deserted them one by\\n\\none.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe men had been staunch enough in their devotion and loyalty as long\\n\\nas they were in no danger of being overtaken by the Russian and his\\n\\nparty. They had heard, however, so much of the atrocious disposition of\\n\\nRokoff that they had grown to hold him in mortal terror, and now that\\n\\nthey knew he was close upon them their timid hearts would fortify them\\n\\nno longer, and as quickly as possible they deserted the three whites.\\n\\n\\n\\nYet on and on went Anderssen and the girl. The Swede went ahead, to hew\\n\\na way through the brush where the path was entirely overgrown, so that\\n\\non this march it was necessary that the young woman carry the child.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll day they marched. Late in the afternoon they realized that they had\\n\\nfailed. Close behind them they heard the noise of a large safari\\n\\nadvancing along the trail which they had cleared for their pursuers.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen it became quite evident that they must be overtaken in a short\\n\\ntime Anderssen hid Jane behind a large tree, covering her and the child\\n\\nwith brush.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There is a village about a mile farther on,” he said to her. “The\\n\\nMosula told me its location before they deserted us. Ay try to lead the\\n\\nRussian off your trail, then you go on to the village. Ay tank the\\n\\nchief ban friendly to white men—the Mosula tal me he ban. Anyhow, that\\n\\nwas all we can do.\\n\\n\\n\\n“After while you get chief to tak you down by the Mosula village at the\\n\\nsea again, an’ after a while a ship is sure to put into the mouth of\\n\\nthe Ugambi. Then you be all right. Gude-by an’ gude luck to you, lady!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“But where are you going, Sven?” asked Jane. “Why can’t you hide here\\n\\nand go back to the sea with me?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ay gotta tal the Russian you ban dead, so that he don’t luke for you\\n\\nno more,” and Anderssen grinned.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why can’t you join me then after you have told him that?” insisted the\\n\\ngirl.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnderssen shook his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ay don’t tank Ay join anybody any more after Ay tal the Russian you\\n\\nban dead,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You don’t mean that you think he will kill you?” asked Jane, and yet\\n\\nin her heart she knew that that was exactly what the great scoundrel\\n\\nwould do in revenge for his having been thwarted by the Swede.\\n\\nAnderssen did not reply, other than to warn her to silence and point\\n\\ntoward the path along which they had just come.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t care,” whispered Jane Clayton. “I shall not let you die to\\n\\nsave me if I can prevent it in any way. Give me your revolver. I can\\n\\nuse that, and together we may be able to hold them off until we can\\n\\nfind some means of escape.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It won’t work, lady,” replied Anderssen. “They would only get us both,\\n\\nand then Ay couldn’t do you no good at all. Think of the kid, lady, and\\n\\nwhat it would be for you both to fall into Rokoff’s hands again. For\\n\\nhis sake you must do what Ay say. Here, take my rifle and ammunition;\\n\\nyou may need them.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe shoved the gun and bandoleer into the shelter beside Jane. Then he\\n\\nwas gone.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe watched him as he returned along the path to meet the oncoming\\n\\nsafari of the Russian. Soon a turn in the trail hid him from view.\\n\\n\\n\\nHer first impulse was to follow. With the rifle she might be of\\n\\nassistance to him, and, further, she could not bear the terrible\\n\\nthought of being left alone at the mercy of the fearful jungle without\\n\\na single friend to aid her.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe started to crawl from her shelter with the intention of running\\n\\nafter Anderssen as fast as she could. As she drew the baby close to her\\n\\nshe glanced down into its little face.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow red it was! How unnatural the little thing looked. She raised the\\n\\ncheek to hers. It was fiery hot with fever!\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a little gasp of terror Jane Clayton rose to her feet in the\\n\\njungle path. The rifle and bandoleer lay forgotten in the shelter\\n\\nbeside her. Anderssen was forgotten, and Rokoff, and her great peril.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll that rioted through her fear-mad brain was the fearful fact that\\n\\nthis little, helpless child was stricken with the terrible\\n\\njungle-fever, and that she was helpless to do aught to allay its\\n\\nsufferings—sufferings that were sure to come during ensuing intervals\\n\\nof partial consciousness.\\n\\n\\n\\nHer one thought was to find some one who could help her—some woman who\\n\\nhad had children of her own—and with the thought came recollection of\\n\\nthe friendly village of which Anderssen had spoken. If she could but\\n\\nreach it—in time!\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was no time to be lost. Like a startled antelope she turned and\\n\\nfled up the trail in the direction Anderssen had indicated.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom far behind came the sudden shouting of men, the sound of shots,\\n\\nand then silence. She knew that Anderssen had met the Russian.\\n\\n\\n\\nA half-hour later she stumbled, exhausted, into a little thatched\\n\\nvillage. Instantly she was surrounded by men, women, and children.\\n\\nEager, curious, excited natives plied her with a hundred questions, no\\n\\none of which she could understand or answer.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll that she could do was to point tearfully at the baby, now wailing\\n\\npiteously in her arms, and repeat over and over, “Fever—fever—fever.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe blacks did not understand her words, but they saw the cause of her\\n\\ntrouble, and soon a young woman had pulled her into a hut and with\\n\\nseveral others was doing her poor best to quiet the child and allay its\\n\\nagony.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe witch doctor came and built a little fire before the infant, upon\\n\\nwhich he boiled some strange concoction in a small earthen pot, making\\n\\nweird passes above it and mumbling strange, monotonous chants.\\n\\nPresently he dipped a zebra’s tail into the brew, and with further\\n\\nmutterings and incantations sprinkled a few drops of the liquid over\\n\\nthe baby’s face.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter he had gone the women sat about and moaned and wailed until Jane\\n\\nthought that she should go mad; but, knowing that they were doing it\\n\\nall out of the kindness of their hearts, she endured the frightful\\n\\nwaking nightmare of those awful hours in dumb and patient suffering.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt must have been well toward midnight that she became conscious of a\\n\\nsudden commotion in the village. She heard the voices of the natives\\n\\nraised in controversy, but she could not understand the words.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently she heard footsteps approaching the hut in which she squatted\\n\\nbefore a bright fire with the baby on her lap. The little thing lay\\n\\nvery still now, its lids, half-raised, showed the pupils horribly\\n\\nupturned.\\n\\n\\n\\nJane Clayton looked into the little face with fear-haunted eyes. It was\\n\\nnot her baby—not her flesh and blood—but how close, how dear the tiny,\\n\\nhelpless thing had become to her. Her heart, bereft of its own, had\\n\\ngone out to this poor, little, nameless waif, and lavished upon it all\\n\\nthe love that had been denied her during the long, bitter weeks of her\\n\\ncaptivity aboard the Kincaid.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe saw that the end was near, and though she was terrified at\\n\\ncontemplation of her loss, still she hoped that it would come quickly\\n\\nnow and end the sufferings of the little victim.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe footsteps she had heard without the hut now halted before the door.\\n\\nThere was a whispered colloquy, and a moment later M’ganwazam, chief of\\n\\nthe tribe, entered. She had seen but little of him, as the women had\\n\\ntaken her in hand almost as soon as she had entered the village.\\n\\n\\n\\nM’ganwazam, she now saw, was an evil-appearing savage with every mark\\n\\nof brutal degeneracy writ large upon his bestial countenance. To Jane\\n\\nClayton he looked more gorilla than human. He tried to converse with\\n\\nher, but without success, and finally he called to some one without.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn answer to his summons another Negro entered—a man of very different\\n\\nappearance from M’ganwazam—so different, in fact, that Jane Clayton\\n\\nimmediately decided that he was of another tribe. This man acted as\\n\\ninterpreter, and almost from the first question that M’ganwazam put to\\n\\nher, Jane felt an intuitive conviction that the savage was attempting\\n\\nto draw information from her for some ulterior motive.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe thought it strange that the fellow should so suddenly have become\\n\\ninterested in her plans, and especially in her intended destination\\n\\nwhen her journey had been interrupted at his village.\\n\\n\\n\\nSeeing no reason for withholding the information, she told him the\\n\\ntruth; but when he asked if she expected to meet her husband at the end\\n\\nof the trip, she shook her head negatively.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen he told her the purpose of his visit, talking through the\\n\\ninterpreter.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I have just learned,” he said, “from some men who live by the side of\\n\\nthe great water, that your husband followed you up the Ugambi for\\n\\nseveral marches, when he was at last set upon by natives and killed.\\n\\nTherefore I have told you this that you might not waste your time in a\\n\\nlong journey if you expected to meet your husband at the end of it; but\\n\\ninstead could turn and retrace your steps to the coast.”\\n\\n\\n\\nJane thanked M’ganwazam for his kindness, though her heart was numb\\n\\nwith suffering at this new blow. She who had suffered so much was at\\n\\nlast beyond reach of the keenest of misery’s pangs, for her senses were\\n\\nnumbed and calloused.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith bowed head she sat staring with unseeing eyes upon the face of the\\n\\nbaby in her lap. M’ganwazam had left the hut. Sometime later she heard\\n\\na noise at the entrance—another had entered. One of the women sitting\\n\\nopposite her threw a faggot upon the dying embers of the fire between\\n\\nthem.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a sudden flare it burst into renewed flame, lighting up the hut’s\\n\\ninterior as though by magic.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe flame disclosed to Jane Clayton’s horrified gaze that the baby was\\n\\nquite dead. How long it had been so she could not guess.\\n\\n\\n\\nA choking lump rose to her throat, her head drooped in silent misery\\n\\nupon the little bundle that she had caught suddenly to her breast.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a moment the silence of the hut was unbroken. Then the native woman\\n\\nbroke into a hideous wail.\\n\\n\\n\\nA man coughed close before Jane Clayton and spoke her name.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a start she raised her eyes to look into the sardonic countenance\\n\\nof Nikolas Rokoff.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII.\\n\\nEscape\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a moment Rokoff stood sneering down upon Jane Clayton, then his\\n\\neyes fell to the little bundle in her lap. Jane had drawn one corner of\\n\\nthe blanket over the child’s face, so that to one who did not know the\\n\\ntruth it seemed but to be sleeping.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You have gone to a great deal of unnecessary trouble,” said Rokoff,\\n\\n“to bring the child to this village. If you had attended to your own\\n\\naffairs I should have brought it here myself.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You would have been spared the dangers and fatigue of the journey. But\\n\\nI suppose I must thank you for relieving me of the inconvenience of\\n\\nhaving to care for a young infant on the march.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This is the village to which the child was destined from the first.\\n\\nM’ganwazam will rear him carefully, making a good cannibal of him, and\\n\\nif you ever chance to return to civilization it will doubtless afford\\n\\nyou much food for thought as you compare the luxuries and comforts of\\n\\nyour life with the details of the life your son is living in the\\n\\nvillage of the Waganwazam.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Again I thank you for bringing him here for me, and now I must ask you\\n\\nto surrender him to me, that I may turn him over to his foster\\n\\nparents.” As he concluded Rokoff held out his hands for the child, a\\n\\nnasty grin of vindictiveness upon his lips.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo his surprise Jane Clayton rose and, without a word of protest, laid\\n\\nthe little bundle in his arms.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Here is the child,” she said. “Thank God he is beyond your power to\\n\\nharm.”\\n\\n\\n\\nGrasping the import of her words, Rokoff snatched the blanket from the\\n\\nchild’s face to seek confirmation of his fears. Jane Clayton watched\\n\\nhis expression closely.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe had been puzzled for days for an answer to the question of Rokoff’s\\n\\nknowledge of the child’s identity. If she had been in doubt before the\\n\\nlast shred of that doubt was wiped away as she witnessed the terrible\\n\\nanger of the Russian as he looked upon the dead face of the baby and\\n\\nrealized that at the last moment his dearest wish for vengeance had\\n\\nbeen thwarted by a higher power.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlmost throwing the body of the child back into Jane Clayton’s arms,\\n\\nRokoff stamped up and down the hut, pounding the air with his clenched\\n\\nfists and cursing terribly. At last he halted in front of the young\\n\\nwoman, bringing his face down close to hers.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are laughing at me,” he shrieked. “You think that you have beaten\\n\\nme—eh? I’ll show you, as I have shown the miserable ape you call\\n\\n‘husband,’ what it means to interfere with the plans of Nikolas Rokoff.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You have robbed me of the child. I cannot make him the son of a\\n\\ncannibal chief, but”—and he paused as though to let the full meaning of\\n\\nhis threat sink deep—“I can make the mother the wife of a cannibal, and\\n\\nthat I shall do—after I have finished with her myself.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIf he had thought to wring from Jane Clayton any sign of terror he\\n\\nfailed miserably. She was beyond that. Her brain and nerves were numb\\n\\nto suffering and shock.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo his surprise a faint, almost happy smile touched her lips. She was\\n\\nthinking with thankful heart that this poor little corpse was not that\\n\\nof her own wee Jack, and that—best of all—Rokoff evidently did not know\\n\\nthe truth.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe would have liked to have flaunted the fact in his face, but she\\n\\ndared not. If he continued to believe that the child had been hers, so\\n\\nmuch safer would be the real Jack wherever he might be. She had, of\\n\\ncourse, no knowledge of the whereabouts of her little son—she did not\\n\\nknow, even, that he still lived, and yet there was the chance that he\\n\\nmight.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was more than possible that without Rokoff’s knowledge this child\\n\\nhad been substituted for hers by one of the Russian’s confederates, and\\n\\nthat even now her son might be safe with friends in London, where there\\n\\nwere many, both able and willing, to have paid any ransom which the\\n\\ntraitorous conspirator might have asked for the safe release of Lord\\n\\nGreystoke’s son.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe had thought it all out a hundred times since she had discovered\\n\\nthat the baby which Anderssen had placed in her arms that night upon\\n\\nthe Kincaid was not her own, and it had been a constant and gnawing\\n\\nsource of happiness to her to dream the whole fantasy through in its\\n\\nevery detail.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo, the Russian must never know that this was not her baby. She\\n\\nrealized that her position was hopeless—with Anderssen and her husband\\n\\ndead there was no one in all the world with a desire to succour her who\\n\\nknew where she might be found.\\n\\n\\n\\nRokoff’s threat, she realized, was no idle one. That he would do, or\\n\\nattempt to do, all that he had promised, she was perfectly sure; but at\\n\\nthe worst it meant but a little earlier release from the hideous\\n\\nanguish that she had been enduring. She must find some way to take her\\n\\nown life before the Russian could harm her further.\\n\\n\\n\\nJust now she wanted time—time to think and prepare herself for the end.\\n\\nShe felt that she could not take the last, awful step until she had\\n\\nexhausted every possibility of escape. She did not care to live unless\\n\\nshe might find her way back to her own child, but slight as such a hope\\n\\nappeared she would not admit its impossibility until the last moment\\n\\nhad come, and she faced the fearful reality of choosing between the\\n\\nfinal alternatives—Nikolas Rokoff on one hand and self-destruction upon\\n\\nthe other.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Go away!” she said to the Russian. “Go away and leave me in peace with\\n\\nmy dead. Have you not brought sufficient misery and anguish upon me\\n\\nwithout attempting to harm me further? What wrong have I ever done you\\n\\nthat you should persist in persecuting me?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are suffering for the sins of the monkey you chose when you might\\n\\nhave had the love of a gentleman—of Nikolas Rokoff,” he replied. “But\\n\\nwhere is the use in discussing the matter? We shall bury the child\\n\\nhere, and you will return with me at once to my own camp. Tomorrow I\\n\\nshall bring you back and turn you over to your new husband—the lovely\\n\\nM’ganwazam. Come!”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe reached out for the child. Jane, who was on her feet now, turned\\n\\naway from him.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I shall bury the body,” she said. “Send some men to dig a grave\\n\\noutside the village.”\\n\\n\\n\\nRokoff was anxious to have the thing over and get back to his camp with\\n\\nhis victim. He thought he saw in her apathy a resignation to her fate.\\n\\nStepping outside the hut, he motioned her to follow him, and a moment\\n\\nlater, with his men, he escorted Jane beyond the village, where beneath\\n\\na great tree the blacks scooped a shallow grave.\\n\\n\\n\\nWrapping the tiny body in a blanket, Jane laid it tenderly in the black\\n\\nhole, and, turning her head that she might not see the mouldy earth\\n\\nfalling upon the pitiful little bundle, she breathed a prayer beside\\n\\nthe grave of the nameless waif that had won its way to the innermost\\n\\nrecesses of her heart.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen, dry-eyed but suffering, she rose and followed the Russian through\\n\\nthe Stygian blackness of the jungle, along the winding, leafy corridor\\n\\nthat led from the village of M’ganwazam, the black cannibal, to the\\n\\ncamp of Nikolas Rokoff, the white fiend.\\n\\n\\n\\nBeside them, in the impenetrable thickets that fringed the path, rising\\n\\nto arch above it and shut out the moon, the girl could hear the\\n\\nstealthy, muffled footfalls of great beasts, and ever round about them\\n\\nrose the deafening roars of hunting lions, until the earth trembled to\\n\\nthe mighty sound.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe porters lighted torches now and waved them upon either hand to\\n\\nfrighten off the beasts of prey. Rokoff urged them to greater speed,\\n\\nand from the quavering note in his voice Jane Clayton knew that he was\\n\\nweak from terror.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sounds of the jungle night recalled most vividly the days and\\n\\nnights that she had spent in a similar jungle with her forest god—with\\n\\nthe fearless and unconquerable Tarzan of the Apes. Then there had been\\n\\nno thoughts of terror, though the jungle noises were new to her, and\\n\\nthe roar of a lion had seemed the most awe-inspiring sound upon the\\n\\ngreat earth.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow different would it be now if she knew that he was somewhere there\\n\\nin the wilderness, seeking her! Then, indeed, would there be that for\\n\\nwhich to live, and every reason to believe that succour was close at\\n\\nhand—but he was dead! It was incredible that it should be so.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere seemed no place in death for that great body and those mighty\\n\\nthews. Had Rokoff been the one to tell her of her lord’s passing she\\n\\nwould have known that he lied. There could be no reason, she thought,\\n\\nwhy M’ganwazam should have deceived her. She did not know that the\\n\\nRussian had talked with the savage a few minutes before the chief had\\n\\ncome to her with his tale.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt last they reached the rude boma that Rokoff’s porters had thrown up\\n\\nround the Russian’s camp. Here they found all in turmoil. She did not\\n\\nknow what it was all about, but she saw that Rokoff was very angry, and\\n\\nfrom bits of conversation which she could translate she gleaned that\\n\\nthere had been further desertions while he had been absent, and that\\n\\nthe deserters had taken the bulk of his food and ammunition.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen he had done venting his rage upon those who remained he returned\\n\\nto where Jane stood under guard of a couple of his white sailors. He\\n\\ngrasped her roughly by the arm and started to drag her toward his tent.\\n\\nThe girl struggled and fought to free herself, while the two sailors\\n\\nstood by, laughing at the rare treat.\\n\\n\\n\\nRokoff did not hesitate to use rough methods when he found that he was\\n\\nto have difficulty in carrying out his designs. Repeatedly he struck\\n\\nJane Clayton in the face, until at last, half-conscious, she was\\n\\ndragged within his tent.\\n\\n\\n\\nRokoff’s boy had lighted the Russian’s lamp, and now at a word from his\\n\\nmaster he made himself scarce. Jane had sunk to the floor in the middle\\n\\nof the enclosure. Slowly her numbed senses were returning to her and\\n\\nshe was commencing to think very fast indeed. Quickly her eyes ran\\n\\nround the interior of the tent, taking in every detail of its equipment\\n\\nand contents.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow the Russian was lifting her to her feet and attempting to drag her\\n\\nto the camp cot that stood at one side of the tent. At his belt hung a\\n\\nheavy revolver. Jane Clayton’s eyes riveted themselves upon it. Her\\n\\npalm itched to grasp the huge butt. She feigned again to swoon, but\\n\\nthrough her half-closed lids she waited her opportunity.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt came just as Rokoff was lifting her upon the cot. A noise at the\\n\\ntent door behind him brought his head quickly about and away from the\\n\\ngirl. The butt of the gun was not an inch from her hand. With a single,\\n\\nlightning-like move she snatched the weapon from its holster, and at\\n\\nthe same instant Rokoff turned back toward her, realizing his peril.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe did not dare fire for fear the shot would bring his people about\\n\\nhim, and with Rokoff dead she would fall into hands no better than his\\n\\nand to a fate probably even worse than he alone could have imagined.\\n\\nThe memory of the two brutes who stood and laughed as Rokoff struck her\\n\\nwas still vivid.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the rage and fear-filled countenance of the Slav turned toward her\\n\\nJane Clayton raised the heavy revolver high above the pasty face and\\n\\nwith all her strength dealt the man a terrific blow between the eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\nWithout a sound he sank, limp and unconscious, to the ground. A moment\\n\\nlater the girl stood beside him—for a moment at least free from the\\n\\nmenace of his lust.\\n\\n\\n\\nOutside the tent she again heard the noise that had distracted Rokoff’s\\n\\nattention. What it was she did not know, but, fearing the return of the\\n\\nservant and the discovery of her deed, she stepped quickly to the camp\\n\\ntable upon which burned the oil lamp and extinguished the smudgy,\\n\\nevil-smelling flame.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the total darkness of the interior she paused for a moment to\\n\\ncollect her wits and plan for the next step in her venture for freedom.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout her was a camp of enemies. Beyond these foes a black wilderness\\n\\nof savage jungle peopled by hideous beasts of prey and still more\\n\\nhideous human beasts.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was little or no chance that she could survive even a few days of\\n\\nthe constant dangers that would confront her there; but the knowledge\\n\\nthat she had already passed through so many perils unscathed, and that\\n\\nsomewhere out in the faraway world a little child was doubtless at that\\n\\nvery moment crying for her, filled her with determination to make the\\n\\neffort to accomplish the seemingly impossible and cross that awful land\\n\\nof horror in search of the sea and the remote chance of succour she\\n\\nmight find there.\\n\\n\\n\\nRokoff’s tent stood almost exactly in the centre of the boma.\\n\\nSurrounding it were the tents and shelters of his white companions and\\n\\nthe natives of his safari. To pass through these and find egress\\n\\nthrough the boma seemed a task too fraught with insurmountable\\n\\nobstacles to warrant even the slightest consideration, and yet there\\n\\nwas no other way.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo remain in the tent until she should be discovered would be to set at\\n\\nnaught all that she had risked to gain her freedom, and so with\\n\\nstealthy step and every sense alert she approached the back of the tent\\n\\nto set out upon the first stage of her adventure.\\n\\n\\n\\nGroping along the rear of the canvas wall, she found that there was no\\n\\nopening there. Quickly she returned to the side of the unconscious\\n\\nRussian. In his belt her groping fingers came upon the hilt of a long\\n\\nhunting-knife, and with this she cut a hole in the back wall of the\\n\\ntent.\\n\\n\\n\\nSilently she stepped without. To her immense relief she saw that the\\n\\ncamp was apparently asleep. In the dim and flickering light of the\\n\\ndying fires she saw but a single sentry, and he was dozing upon his\\n\\nhaunches at the opposite side of the enclosure.\\n\\n\\n\\nKeeping the tent between him and herself, she crossed between the small\\n\\nshelters of the native porters to the boma wall beyond.\\n\\n\\n\\nOutside, in the darkness of the tangled jungle, she could hear the\\n\\nroaring of lions, the laughing of hyenas, and the countless, nameless\\n\\nnoises of the midnight jungle.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a moment she hesitated, trembling. The thought of the prowling\\n\\nbeasts out there in the darkness was appalling. Then, with a sudden\\n\\nbrave toss of her head, she attacked the thorny boma wall with her\\n\\ndelicate hands. Torn and bleeding though they were, she worked on\\n\\nbreathlessly until she had made an opening through which she could worm\\n\\nher body, and at last she stood outside the enclosure.\\n\\n\\n\\nBehind her lay a fate worse than death, at the hands of human beings.\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore her lay an almost certain fate—but it was only death—sudden,\\n\\nmerciful, and honourable death.\\n\\n\\n\\nWithout a tremor and without regret she darted away from the camp, and\\n\\na moment later the mysterious jungle had closed about her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV.\\n\\nAlone in the Jungle\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTambudza, leading Tarzan of the Apes toward the camp of the Russian,\\n\\nmoved very slowly along the winding jungle path, for she was old and\\n\\nher legs stiff with rheumatism.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo it was that the runners dispatched by M’ganwazam to warn Rokoff that\\n\\nthe white giant was in his village and that he would be slain that\\n\\nnight reached the Russian’s camp before Tarzan and his ancient guide\\n\\nhad covered half the distance.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe guides found the white man’s camp in a turmoil. Rokoff had that\\n\\nmorning been discovered stunned and bleeding within his tent. When he\\n\\nhad recovered his senses and realized that Jane Clayton had escaped,\\n\\nhis rage was boundless.\\n\\n\\n\\nRushing about the camp with his rifle, he had sought to shoot down the\\n\\nnative sentries who had allowed the young woman to elude their\\n\\nvigilance, but several of the other whites, realizing that they were\\n\\nalready in a precarious position owing to the numerous desertions that\\n\\nRokoff’s cruelty had brought about, seized and disarmed him.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen came the messengers from M’ganwazam, but scarce had they told\\n\\ntheir story and Rokoff was preparing to depart with them for their\\n\\nvillage when other runners, panting from the exertions of their swift\\n\\nflight through the jungle, rushed breathless into the firelight, crying\\n\\nthat the great white giant had escaped from M’ganwazam and was already\\n\\non his way to wreak vengeance against his enemies.\\n\\n\\n\\nInstantly confusion reigned within the encircling boma. The blacks\\n\\nbelonging to Rokoff’s safari were terror-stricken at the thought of the\\n\\nproximity of the white giant who hunted through the jungle with a\\n\\nfierce pack of apes and panthers at his heels.\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore the whites realized what had happened the superstitious fears of\\n\\nthe natives had sent them scurrying into the bush—their own carriers as\\n\\nwell as the messengers from M’ganwazam—but even in their haste they had\\n\\nnot neglected to take with them every article of value upon which they\\n\\ncould lay their hands.\\n\\n\\n\\nThus Rokoff and the seven white sailors found themselves deserted and\\n\\nrobbed in the midst of a wilderness.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Russian, following his usual custom, berated his companions, laying\\n\\nall the blame upon their shoulders for the events which had led up to\\n\\nthe almost hopeless condition in which they now found themselves; but\\n\\nthe sailors were in no mood to brook his insults and his cursing.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the midst of this tirade one of them drew a revolver and fired\\n\\npoint-blank at the Russian. The fellow’s aim was poor, but his act so\\n\\nterrified Rokoff that he turned and fled for his tent.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he ran his eyes chanced to pass beyond the boma to the edge of the\\n\\nforest, and there he caught a glimpse of that which sent his craven\\n\\nheart cold with a fear that almost expunged his terror of the seven men\\n\\nat his back, who by this time were all firing in hate and revenge at\\n\\nhis retreating figure.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat he saw was the giant figure of an almost naked white man emerging\\n\\nfrom the bush.\\n\\n\\n\\nDarting into his tent, the Russian did not halt in his flight, but kept\\n\\nright on through the rear wall, taking advantage of the long slit that\\n\\nJane Clayton had made the night before.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe terror-stricken Muscovite scurried like a hunted rabbit through the\\n\\nhole that still gaped in the boma’s wall at the point where his own\\n\\nprey had escaped, and as Tarzan approached the camp upon the opposite\\n\\nside Rokoff disappeared into the jungle in the wake of Jane Clayton.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the ape-man entered the boma with old Tambudza at his elbow the\\n\\nseven sailors, recognizing him, turned and fled in the opposite\\n\\ndirection. Tarzan saw that Rokoff was not among them, and so he let\\n\\nthem go their way—his business was with the Russian, whom he expected\\n\\nto find in his tent. As to the sailors, he was sure that the jungle\\n\\nwould exact from them expiation for their villainies, nor, doubtless,\\n\\nwas he wrong, for his were the last white man’s eyes to rest upon any\\n\\nof them.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinding Rokoff’s tent empty, Tarzan was about to set out in search of\\n\\nthe Russian when Tambudza suggested to him that the departure of the\\n\\nwhite man could only have resulted from word reaching him from\\n\\nM’ganwazam that Tarzan was in his village.\\n\\n\\n\\n“He has doubtless hastened there,” argued the old woman. “If you would\\n\\nfind him let us return at once.”\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan himself thought that this would probably prove to be the fact,\\n\\nso he did not waste time in an endeavour to locate the Russian’s trail,\\n\\nbut, instead, set out briskly for the village of M’ganwazam, leaving\\n\\nTambudza to plod slowly in his wake.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis one hope was that Jane was still safe and with Rokoff. If this was\\n\\nthe case, it would be but a matter of an hour or more before he should\\n\\nbe able to wrest her from the Russian.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe knew now that M’ganwazam was treacherous and that he might have to\\n\\nfight to regain possession of his wife. He wished that Mugambi, Sheeta,\\n\\nAkut, and the balance of the pack were with him, for he realized that\\n\\nsingle-handed it would be no child’s play to bring Jane safely from the\\n\\nclutches of two such scoundrels as Rokoff and the wily M’ganwazam.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo his surprise he found no sign of either Rokoff or Jane in the\\n\\nvillage, and as he could not trust the word of the chief, he wasted no\\n\\ntime in futile inquiry. So sudden and unexpected had been his return,\\n\\nand so quickly had he vanished into the jungle after learning that\\n\\nthose he sought were not among the Waganwazam, that old M’ganwazam had\\n\\nno time to prevent his going.\\n\\n\\n\\nSwinging through the trees, he hastened back to the deserted camp he\\n\\nhad so recently left, for here, he knew, was the logical place to take\\n\\nup the trail of Rokoff and Jane.\\n\\n\\n\\nArrived at the boma, he circled carefully about the outside of the\\n\\nenclosure until, opposite a break in the thorny wall, he came to\\n\\nindications that something had recently passed into the jungle. His\\n\\nacute sense of smell told him that both of those he sought had fled\\n\\nfrom the camp in this direction, and a moment later he had taken up the\\n\\ntrail and was following the faint spoor.\\n\\n\\n\\nFar ahead of him a terror-stricken young woman was slinking along a\\n\\nnarrow game-trail, fearful that the next moment would bring her face to\\n\\nface with some savage beast or equally savage man. As she ran on,\\n\\nhoping against hope that she had hit upon the direction that would lead\\n\\nher eventually to the great river, she came suddenly upon a familiar\\n\\nspot.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt one side of the trail, beneath a giant tree, lay a little heap of\\n\\nloosely piled brush—to her dying day that little spot of jungle would\\n\\nbe indelibly impressed upon her memory. It was where Anderssen had\\n\\nhidden her—where he had given up his life in the vain effort to save\\n\\nher from Rokoff.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt sight of it she recalled the rifle and ammunition that the man had\\n\\nthrust upon her at the last moment. Until now she had forgotten them\\n\\nentirely. Still clutched in her hand was the revolver she had snatched\\n\\nfrom Rokoff’s belt, but that could contain at most not over six\\n\\ncartridges—not enough to furnish her with food and protection both on\\n\\nthe long journey to the sea.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith bated breath she groped beneath the little mound, scarce daring to\\n\\nhope that the treasure remained where she had left it; but, to her\\n\\ninfinite relief and joy, her hand came at once upon the barrel of the\\n\\nheavy weapon and then upon the bandoleer of cartridges.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs she threw the latter about her shoulder and felt the weight of the\\n\\nbig game-gun in her hand a sudden sense of security suffused her. It\\n\\nwas with new hope and a feeling almost of assured success that she\\n\\nagain set forward upon her journey.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat night she slept in the crotch of a tree, as Tarzan had so often\\n\\ntold her that he was accustomed to doing, and early the next morning\\n\\nwas upon her way again. Late in the afternoon, as she was about to\\n\\ncross a little clearing, she was startled at the sight of a huge ape\\n\\ncoming from the jungle upon the opposite side.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe wind was blowing directly across the clearing between them, and\\n\\nJane lost no time in putting herself downwind from the huge creature.\\n\\nThen she hid in a clump of heavy bush and watched, holding the rifle\\n\\nready for instant use.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo her consternation she saw that the apes were pausing in the centre\\n\\nof the clearing. They came together in a little knot, where they stood\\n\\nlooking backward, as though in expectation of the coming of others of\\n\\ntheir tribe. Jane wished that they would go on, for she knew that at\\n\\nany moment some little, eddying gust of wind might carry her scent down\\n\\nto their nostrils, and then what would the protection of her rifle\\n\\namount to in the face of those gigantic muscles and mighty fangs?\\n\\n\\n\\nHer eyes moved back and forth between the apes and the edge of the\\n\\njungle toward which they were gazing until at last she perceived the\\n\\nobject of their halt and the thing that they awaited. They were being\\n\\nstalked.\\n\\n\\n\\nOf this she was positive, as she saw the lithe, sinewy form of a\\n\\npanther glide noiselessly from the jungle at the point at which the\\n\\napes had emerged but a moment before.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuickly the beast trotted across the clearing toward the anthropoids.\\n\\nJane wondered at their apparent apathy, and a moment later her wonder\\n\\nturned to amazement as she saw the great cat come quite close to the\\n\\napes, who appeared entirely unconcerned by its presence, and, squatting\\n\\ndown in their midst, fell assiduously to the business of preening,\\n\\nwhich occupies most of the waking hours of the cat family.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the young woman was surprised by the sight of these natural enemies\\n\\nfraternizing, it was with emotions little short of fear for her own\\n\\nsanity that she presently saw a tall, muscular warrior enter the\\n\\nclearing and join the group of savage beasts assembled there.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt first sight of the man she had been positive that he would be torn\\n\\nto pieces, and she had half risen from her shelter, raising her rifle\\n\\nto her shoulder to do what she could to avert the man’s terrible fate.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow she saw that he seemed actually conversing with the beasts—issuing\\n\\norders to them.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently the entire company filed on across the clearing and\\n\\ndisappeared in the jungle upon the opposite side.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a gasp of mingled incredulity and relief Jane Clayton staggered to\\n\\nher feet and fled on away from the terrible horde that had just passed\\n\\nher, while a half-mile behind her another individual, following the\\n\\nsame trail as she, lay frozen with terror behind an ant-hill as the\\n\\nhideous band passed quite close to him.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis one was Rokoff; but he had recognized the members of the awful\\n\\naggregation as allies of Tarzan of the Apes. No sooner, therefore, had\\n\\nthe beasts passed him than he rose and raced through the jungle as fast\\n\\nas he could go, in order that he might put as much distance as possible\\n\\nbetween himself and these frightful beasts.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo it happened that as Jane Clayton came to the bank of the river, down\\n\\nwhich she hoped to float to the ocean and eventual rescue, Nikolas\\n\\nRokoff was but a short distance in her rear.\\n\\n\\n\\nUpon the bank the girl saw a great dugout drawn half-way from the water\\n\\nand tied securely to a near-by tree.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis, she felt, would solve the question of transportation to the sea\\n\\ncould she but launch the huge, unwieldy craft. Unfastening the rope\\n\\nthat had moored it to the tree, Jane pushed frantically upon the bow of\\n\\nthe heavy canoe, but for all the results that were apparent she might\\n\\nas well have been attempting to shove the earth out of its orbit.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe was about winded when it occurred to her to try working the dugout\\n\\ninto the stream by loading the stern with ballast and then rocking the\\n\\nbow back and forth along the bank until the craft eventually worked\\n\\nitself into the river.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere were no stones or rocks available, but along the shore she found\\n\\nquantities of driftwood deposited by the river at a slightly higher\\n\\nstage. These she gathered and piled far in the stern of the boat, until\\n\\nat last, to her immense relief, she saw the bow rise gently from the\\n\\nmud of the bank and the stern drift slowly with the current until it\\n\\nagain lodged a few feet farther down-stream.\\n\\n\\n\\nJane found that by running back and forth between the bow and stern she\\n\\ncould alternately raise and lower each end of the boat as she shifted\\n\\nher weight from one end to the other, with the result that each time\\n\\nshe leaped to the stern the canoe moved a few inches farther into the\\n\\nriver.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the success of her plan approached more closely to fruition she\\n\\nbecame so wrapped in her efforts that she failed to note the figure of\\n\\na man standing beneath a huge tree at the edge of the jungle from which\\n\\nhe had just emerged.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe watched her and her labours with a cruel and malicious grin upon his\\n\\nswarthy countenance.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe boat at last became so nearly free of the retarding mud and of the\\n\\nbank that Jane felt positive that she could pole it off into deeper\\n\\nwater with one of the paddles which lay in the bottom of the rude\\n\\ncraft. With this end in view she seized upon one of these implements\\n\\nand had just plunged it into the river bottom close to the shore when\\n\\nher eyes happened to rise to the edge of the jungle.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs her gaze fell upon the figure of the man a little cry of terror rose\\n\\nto her lips. It was Rokoff.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was running toward her now and shouting to her to wait or he would\\n\\nshoot—though as he was entirely unarmed it was difficult to discover\\n\\njust how he intended making good his threat.\\n\\n\\n\\nJane Clayton knew nothing of the various misfortunes that had befallen\\n\\nthe Russian since she had escaped from his tent, so she believed that\\n\\nhis followers must be close at hand.\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, she had no intention of falling again into the man’s clutches.\\n\\nShe would rather die at once than that that should happen to her.\\n\\nAnother minute and the boat would be free.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce in the current of the river she would be beyond Rokoff’s power to\\n\\nstop her, for there was no other boat upon the shore, and no man, and\\n\\ncertainly not the cowardly Rokoff, would dare to attempt to swim the\\n\\ncrocodile-infested water in an effort to overtake her.\\n\\n\\n\\nRokoff, on his part, was bent more upon escape than aught else. He\\n\\nwould gladly have forgone any designs he might have had upon Jane\\n\\nClayton would she but permit him to share this means of escape that she\\n\\nhad discovered. He would promise anything if she would let him come\\n\\naboard the dugout, but he did not think that it was necessary to do so.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe saw that he could easily reach the bow of the boat before it cleared\\n\\nthe shore, and then it would not be necessary to make promises of any\\n\\nsort. Not that Rokoff would have felt the slightest compunction in\\n\\nignoring any promises he might have made the girl, but he disliked the\\n\\nidea of having to sue for favour with one who had so recently assaulted\\n\\nand escaped him.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlready he was gloating over the days and nights of revenge that would\\n\\nbe his while the heavy dugout drifted its slow way to the ocean.\\n\\n\\n\\nJane Clayton, working furiously to shove the boat beyond his reach,\\n\\nsuddenly realized that she was to be successful, for with a little\\n\\nlurch the dugout swung quickly into the current, just as the Russian\\n\\nreached out to place his hand upon its bow.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis fingers did not miss their goal by a half-dozen inches. The girl\\n\\nalmost collapsed with the reaction from the terrific mental, physical,\\n\\nand nervous strain under which she had been labouring for the past few\\n\\nminutes. But, thank Heaven, at last she was safe!\\n\\n\\n\\nEven as she breathed a silent prayer of thanksgiving, she saw a sudden\\n\\nexpression of triumph lighten the features of the cursing Russian, and\\n\\nat the same instant he dropped suddenly to the ground, grasping firmly\\n\\nupon something which wriggled through the mud toward the water.\\n\\n\\n\\nJane Clayton crouched, wide-eyed and horror-stricken, in the bottom of\\n\\nthe boat as she realized that at the last instant success had been\\n\\nturned to failure, and that she was indeed again in the power of the\\n\\nmalignant Rokoff.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the thing that the man had seen and grasped was the end of the\\n\\ntrailing rope with which the dugout had been moored to the tree.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV.\\n\\nDown the Ugambi\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHalfway between the Ugambi and the village of the Waganwazam, Tarzan\\n\\ncame upon the pack moving slowly along his old spoor. Mugambi could\\n\\nscarce believe that the trail of the Russian and the mate of his savage\\n\\nmaster had passed so close to that of the pack.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt seemed incredible that two human beings should have come so close to\\n\\nthem without having been detected by some of the marvellously keen and\\n\\nalert beasts; but Tarzan pointed out the spoor of the two he trailed,\\n\\nand at certain points the black could see that the man and the woman\\n\\nmust have been in hiding as the pack passed them, watching every move\\n\\nof the ferocious creatures.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt had been apparent to Tarzan from the first that Jane and Rokoff were\\n\\nnot travelling together. The spoor showed distinctly that the young\\n\\nwoman had been a considerable distance ahead of the Russian at first,\\n\\nthough the farther the ape-man continued along the trail the more\\n\\nobvious it became that the man was rapidly overhauling his quarry.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt first there had been the spoor of wild beasts over the footprints of\\n\\nJane Clayton, while upon the top of all Rokoff’s spoor showed that he\\n\\nhad passed over the trail after the animals had left their records upon\\n\\nthe ground. But later there were fewer and fewer animal imprints\\n\\noccurring between those of Jane’s and the Russian’s feet, until as he\\n\\napproached the river the ape-man became aware that Rokoff could not\\n\\nhave been more than a few hundred yards behind the girl.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe felt they must be close ahead of him now, and, with a little thrill\\n\\nof expectation, he leaped rapidly forward ahead of the pack. Swinging\\n\\nswiftly through the trees, he came out upon the river-bank at the very\\n\\npoint at which Rokoff had overhauled Jane as she endeavoured to launch\\n\\nthe cumbersome dugout.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the mud along the bank the ape-man saw the footprints of the two he\\n\\nsought, but there was neither boat nor people there when he arrived,\\n\\nnor, at first glance, any sign of their whereabouts.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was plain that they had shoved off a native canoe and embarked upon\\n\\nthe bosom of the stream, and as the ape-man’s eye ran swiftly down the\\n\\ncourse of the river beneath the shadows of the overarching trees he saw\\n\\nin the distance, just as it rounded a bend that shut it off from his\\n\\nview, a drifting dugout in the stern of which was the figure of a man.\\n\\n\\n\\nJust as the pack came in sight of the river they saw their agile leader\\n\\nracing down the river’s bank, leaping from hummock to hummock of the\\n\\nswampy ground that spread between them and a little promontory which\\n\\nrose just where the river curved inward from their sight.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo follow him it was necessary for the heavy, cumbersome apes to make a\\n\\nwide detour, and Sheeta, too, who hated water. Mugambi followed after\\n\\nthem as rapidly as he could in the wake of the great white master.\\n\\n\\n\\nA half-hour of rapid travelling across the swampy neck of land and over\\n\\nthe rising promontory brought Tarzan, by a short cut, to the inward\\n\\nbend of the winding river, and there before him upon the bosom of the\\n\\nstream he saw the dugout, and in its stern Nikolas Rokoff.\\n\\n\\n\\nJane was not with the Russian.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt sight of his enemy the broad scar upon the ape-man’s brow burned\\n\\nscarlet, and there rose to his lips the hideous, bestial challenge of\\n\\nthe bull-ape.\\n\\n\\n\\nRokoff shuddered as the weird and terrible alarm fell upon his ears.\\n\\nCowering in the bottom of the boat, his teeth chattering in terror, he\\n\\nwatched the man he feared above all other creatures upon the face of\\n\\nthe earth as he ran quickly to the edge of the water.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven though the Russian knew that he was safe from his enemy, the very\\n\\nsight of him threw him into a frenzy of trembling cowardice, which\\n\\nbecame frantic hysteria as he saw the white giant dive fearlessly into\\n\\nthe forbidding waters of the tropical river.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith steady, powerful strokes the ape-man forged out into the stream\\n\\ntoward the drifting dugout. Now Rokoff seized one of the paddles lying\\n\\nin the bottom of the craft, and, with terrorwide eyes still glued upon\\n\\nthe living death that pursued him, struck out madly in an effort to\\n\\naugment the speed of the unwieldy canoe.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd from the opposite bank a sinister ripple, unseen by either man,\\n\\nmoved steadily toward the half-naked swimmer.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan had reached the stern of the craft at last. One hand upstretched\\n\\ngrasped the gunwale. Rokoff sat frozen with fear, unable to move a hand\\n\\nor foot, his eyes riveted upon the face of his Nemesis.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen a sudden commotion in the water behind the swimmer caught his\\n\\nattention. He saw the ripple, and he knew what caused it.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the same instant Tarzan felt mighty jaws close upon his right leg.\\n\\nHe tried to struggle free and raise himself over the side of the boat.\\n\\nHis efforts would have succeeded had not this unexpected interruption\\n\\ngalvanized the malign brain of the Russian into instant action with its\\n\\nsudden promise of deliverance and revenge.\\n\\n\\n\\nLike a venomous snake the man leaped toward the stern of the boat, and\\n\\nwith a single swift blow struck Tarzan across the head with the heavy\\n\\npaddle. The ape-man’s fingers slipped from their hold upon the gunwale.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a short struggle at the surface, and then a swirl of waters,\\n\\na little eddy, and a burst of bubbles soon smoothed out by the flowing\\n\\ncurrent marked for the instant the spot where Tarzan of the Apes, Lord\\n\\nof the Jungle, disappeared from the sight of men beneath the gloomy\\n\\nwaters of the dark and forbidding Ugambi.\\n\\n\\n\\nWeak from terror, Rokoff sank shuddering into the bottom of the dugout.\\n\\nFor a moment he could not realize the good fortune that had befallen\\n\\nhim—all that he could see was the figure of a silent, struggling white\\n\\nman disappearing beneath the surface of the river to unthinkable death\\n\\nin the slimy mud of the bottom.\\n\\n\\n\\nSlowly all that it meant to him filtered into the mind of the Russian,\\n\\nand then a cruel smile of relief and triumph touched his lips; but it\\n\\nwas short-lived, for just as he was congratulating himself that he was\\n\\nnow comparatively safe to proceed upon his way to the coast unmolested,\\n\\na mighty pandemonium rose from the river-bank close by.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs his eyes sought the authors of the frightful sound he saw standing\\n\\nupon the shore, glaring at him with hate-filled eyes, a devil-faced\\n\\npanther surrounded by the hideous apes of Akut, and in the forefront of\\n\\nthem a giant black warrior who shook his fist at him, threatening him\\n\\nwith terrible death.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe nightmare of that flight down the Ugambi with the hideous horde\\n\\nracing after him by day and by night, now abreast of him, now lost in\\n\\nthe mazes of the jungle far behind for hours and once for a whole day,\\n\\nonly to reappear again upon his trail grim, relentless, and terrible,\\n\\nreduced the Russian from a strong and robust man to an emaciated,\\n\\nwhite-haired, fear-gibbering thing before ever the bay and the ocean\\n\\nbroke upon his hopeless vision.\\n\\n\\n\\nPast populous villages he had fled. Time and again warriors had put out\\n\\nin their canoes to intercept him, but each time the hideous horde had\\n\\nswept into view to send the terrified natives shrieking back to the\\n\\nshore to lose themselves in the jungle.\\n\\n\\n\\nNowhere in his flight had he seen aught of Jane Clayton. Not once had\\n\\nhis eyes rested upon her since that moment at the river’s brim his hand\\n\\nhad closed upon the rope attached to the bow of her dugout and he had\\n\\nbelieved her safely in his power again, only to be thwarted an instant\\n\\nlater as the girl snatched up a heavy express rifle from the bottom of\\n\\nthe craft and levelled it full at his breast.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuickly he had dropped the rope then and seen her float away beyond his\\n\\nreach, but a moment later he had been racing up-stream toward a little\\n\\ntributary in the mouth of which was hidden the canoe in which he and\\n\\nhis party had come thus far upon their journey in pursuit of the girl\\n\\nand Anderssen.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat had become of her?\\n\\n\\n\\nThere seemed little doubt in the Russian’s mind, however, but that she\\n\\nhad been captured by warriors from one of the several villages she\\n\\nwould have been compelled to pass on her way down to the sea. Well, he\\n\\nwas at least rid of most of his human enemies.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut at that he would gladly have had them all back in the land of the\\n\\nliving could he thus have been freed from the menace of the frightful\\n\\ncreatures who pursued him with awful relentlessness, screaming and\\n\\ngrowling at him every time they came within sight of him. The one that\\n\\nfilled him with the greatest terror was the panther—the flaming-eyed,\\n\\ndevil-faced panther whose grinning jaws gaped wide at him by day, and\\n\\nwhose fiery orbs gleamed wickedly out across the water from the\\n\\nCimmerian blackness of the jungle nights.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sight of the mouth of the Ugambi filled Rokoff with renewed hope,\\n\\nfor there, upon the yellow waters of the bay, floated the Kincaid at\\n\\nanchor. He had sent the little steamer away to coal while he had gone\\n\\nup the river, leaving Paulvitch in charge of her, and he could have\\n\\ncried aloud in his relief as he saw that she had returned in time to\\n\\nsave him.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrantically he alternately paddled furiously toward her and rose to his\\n\\nfeet waving his paddle and crying aloud in an attempt to attract the\\n\\nattention of those on board. But loud as he screamed his cries awakened\\n\\nno answering challenge from the deck of the silent craft.\\n\\n\\n\\nUpon the shore behind him a hurried backward glance revealed the\\n\\npresence of the snarling pack. Even now, he thought, these manlike\\n\\ndevils might yet find a way to reach him even upon the deck of the\\n\\nsteamer unless there were those there to repel them with firearms.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat could have happened to those he had left upon the Kincaid? Where\\n\\nwas Paulvitch? Could it be that the vessel was deserted, and that,\\n\\nafter all, he was doomed to be overtaken by the terrible fate that he\\n\\nhad been flying from through all these hideous days and nights? He\\n\\nshivered as might one upon whose brow death has already laid his clammy\\n\\nfinger.\\n\\n\\n\\nYet he did not cease to paddle frantically toward the steamer, and at\\n\\nlast, after what seemed an eternity, the bow of the dugout bumped\\n\\nagainst the timbers of the Kincaid. Over the ship’s side hung a\\n\\nmonkey-ladder, but as the Russian grasped it to ascend to the deck he\\n\\nheard a warning challenge from above, and, looking up, gazed into the\\n\\ncold, relentless muzzle of a rifle.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter Jane Clayton, with rifle levelled at the breast of Rokoff, had\\n\\nsucceeded in holding him off until the dugout in which she had taken\\n\\nrefuge had drifted out upon the bosom of the Ugambi beyond the man’s\\n\\nreach, she had lost no time in paddling to the swiftest sweep of the\\n\\nchannel, nor did she for long days and weary nights cease to hold her\\n\\ncraft to the most rapidly moving part of the river, except when during\\n\\nthe hottest hours of the day she had been wont to drift as the current\\n\\nwould take her, lying prone in the bottom of the canoe, her face\\n\\nsheltered from the sun with a great palm leaf.\\n\\n\\n\\nThus only did she gain rest upon the voyage; at other times she\\n\\ncontinually sought to augment the movement of the craft by wielding the\\n\\nheavy paddle.\\n\\n\\n\\nRokoff, on the other hand, had used little or no intelligence in his\\n\\nflight along the Ugambi, so that more often than not his craft had\\n\\ndrifted in the slow-going eddies, for he habitually hugged the bank\\n\\nfarthest from that along which the hideous horde pursued and menaced\\n\\nhim.\\n\\n\\n\\nThus it was that, though he had put out upon the river but a short time\\n\\nsubsequent to the girl, yet she had reached the bay fully two hours\\n\\nahead of him. When she had first seen the anchored ship upon the quiet\\n\\nwater, Jane Clayton’s heart had beat fast with hope and thanksgiving,\\n\\nbut as she drew closer to the craft and saw that it was the Kincaid,\\n\\nher pleasure gave place to the gravest misgivings.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was too late, however, to turn back, for the current that carried\\n\\nher toward the ship was much too strong for her muscles. She could not\\n\\nhave forced the heavy dugout up-stream against it, and all that was\\n\\nleft her was to attempt either to make the shore without being seen by\\n\\nthose upon the deck of the Kincaid, or to throw herself upon their\\n\\nmercy—otherwise she must be swept out to sea.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe knew that the shore held little hope of life for her, as she had no\\n\\nknowledge of the location of the friendly Mosula village to which\\n\\nAnderssen had taken her through the darkness of the night of their\\n\\nescape from the Kincaid.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith Rokoff away from the steamer it might be possible that by offering\\n\\nthose in charge a large reward they could be induced to carry her to\\n\\nthe nearest civilized port. It was worth risking—if she could make the\\n\\nsteamer at all.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe current was bearing her swiftly down the river, and she found that\\n\\nonly by dint of the utmost exertion could she direct the awkward craft\\n\\ntoward the vicinity of the Kincaid. Having reached the decision to\\n\\nboard the steamer, she now looked to it for aid, but to her surprise\\n\\nthe decks appeared to be empty and she saw no sign of life aboard the\\n\\nship.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe dugout was drawing closer and closer to the bow of the vessel, and\\n\\nyet no hail came over the side from any lookout aboard. In a moment\\n\\nmore, Jane realized, she would be swept beyond the steamer, and then,\\n\\nunless they lowered a boat to rescue her, she would be carried far out\\n\\nto sea by the current and the swift ebb tide that was running.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe young woman called loudly for assistance, but there was no reply\\n\\nother than the shrill scream of some savage beast upon the\\n\\njungle-shrouded shore. Frantically Jane wielded the paddle in an effort\\n\\nto carry her craft close alongside the steamer.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a moment it seemed that she should miss her goal by but a few feet,\\n\\nbut at the last moment the canoe swung close beneath the steamer’s bow\\n\\nand Jane barely managed to grasp the anchor chain.\\n\\n\\n\\nHeroically she clung to the heavy iron links, almost dragged from the\\n\\ncanoe by the strain of the current upon her craft. Beyond her she saw a\\n\\nmonkey-ladder dangling over the steamer’s side. To release her hold\\n\\nupon the chain and chance clambering to the ladder as her canoe was\\n\\nswept beneath it seemed beyond the pale of possibility, yet to remain\\n\\nclinging to the anchor chain appeared equally as futile.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally her glance chanced to fall upon the rope in the bow of the\\n\\ndugout, and, making one end of this fast to the chain, she succeeded in\\n\\ndrifting the canoe slowly down until it lay directly beneath the\\n\\nladder. A moment later, her rifle slung about her shoulders, she had\\n\\nclambered safely to the deserted deck.\\n\\n\\n\\nHer first task was to explore the ship, and this she did, her rifle\\n\\nready for instant use should she meet with any human menace aboard the\\n\\nKincaid. She was not long in discovering the cause of the apparently\\n\\ndeserted condition of the steamer, for in the forecastle she found the\\n\\nsailors, who had evidently been left to guard the ship, deep in drunken\\n\\nslumber.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a shudder of disgust she clambered above, and to the best of her\\n\\nability closed and made fast the hatch above the heads of the sleeping\\n\\nguard. Next she sought the galley and food, and, having appeased her\\n\\nhunger, she took her place on deck, determined that none should board\\n\\nthe Kincaid without first having agreed to her demands.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor an hour or so nothing appeared upon the surface of the river to\\n\\ncause her alarm, but then, about a bend up-stream, she saw a canoe\\n\\nappear in which sat a single figure. It had not proceeded far in her\\n\\ndirection before she recognized the occupant as Rokoff, and when the\\n\\nfellow attempted to board he found a rifle staring him in the face.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the Russian discovered who it was that repelled his advance he\\n\\nbecame furious, cursing and threatening in a most horrible manner; but,\\n\\nfinding that these tactics failed to frighten or move the girl, he at\\n\\nlast fell to pleading and promising.\\n\\n\\n\\nJane had but a single reply for his every proposition, and that was\\n\\nthat nothing would ever persuade her to permit Rokoff upon the same\\n\\nvessel with her. That she would put her threats into action and shoot\\n\\nhim should he persist in his endeavour to board the ship he was\\n\\nconvinced.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, as there was no other alternative, the great coward dropped back\\n\\ninto his dugout and, at imminent risk of being swept to sea, finally\\n\\nsucceeded in making the shore far down the bay and upon the opposite\\n\\nside from that on which the horde of beasts stood snarling and roaring.\\n\\n\\n\\nJane Clayton knew that the fellow could not alone and unaided bring his\\n\\nheavy craft back up-stream to the Kincaid, and so she had no further\\n\\nfear of an attack by him. The hideous crew upon the shore she thought\\n\\nshe recognized as the same that had passed her in the jungle far up the\\n\\nUgambi several days before, for it seemed quite beyond reason that\\n\\nthere should be more than one such a strangely assorted pack; but what\\n\\nhad brought them down-stream to the mouth of the river she could not\\n\\nimagine.\\n\\n\\n\\nToward the day’s close the girl was suddenly alarmed by the shouting of\\n\\nthe Russian from the opposite bank of the stream, and a moment later,\\n\\nfollowing the direction of his gaze, she was terrified to see a ship’s\\n\\nboat approaching from up-stream, in which, she felt assured, there\\n\\ncould be only members of the Kincaid’s missing crew—only heartless\\n\\nruffians and enemies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI.\\n\\nIn the Darkness of the Night\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Tarzan of the Apes realized that he was in the grip of the great\\n\\njaws of a crocodile he did not, as an ordinary man might have done,\\n\\ngive up all hope and resign himself to his fate.\\n\\n\\n\\nInstead, he filled his lungs with air before the huge reptile dragged\\n\\nhim beneath the surface, and then, with all the might of his great\\n\\nmuscles, fought bitterly for freedom. But out of his native element the\\n\\nape-man was too greatly handicapped to do more than excite the monster\\n\\nto greater speed as it dragged its prey swiftly through the water.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan’s lungs were bursting for a breath of pure fresh air. He knew\\n\\nthat he could survive but a moment more, and in the last paroxysm of\\n\\nhis suffering he did what he could to avenge his own death.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis body trailed out beside the slimy carcass of his captor, and into\\n\\nthe tough armour the ape-man attempted to plunge his stone knife as he\\n\\nwas borne to the creature’s horrid den.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis efforts but served to accelerate the speed of the crocodile, and\\n\\njust as the ape-man realized that he had reached the limit of his\\n\\nendurance he felt his body dragged to a muddy bed and his nostrils rise\\n\\nabove the water’s surface. All about him was the blackness of the\\n\\npit—the silence of the grave.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a moment Tarzan of the Apes lay gasping for breath upon the slimy,\\n\\nevil-smelling bed to which the animal had borne him. Close at his side\\n\\nhe could feel the cold, hard plates of the creature’s coat rising and\\n\\nfalling as though with spasmodic efforts to breathe.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor several minutes the two lay thus, and then a sudden convulsion of\\n\\nthe giant carcass at the man’s side, a tremor, and a stiffening brought\\n\\nTarzan to his knees beside the crocodile. To his utter amazement he\\n\\nfound that the beast was dead. The slim knife had found a vulnerable\\n\\nspot in the scaly armour.\\n\\n\\n\\nStaggering to his feet, the ape-man groped about the reeking, oozy den.\\n\\nHe found that he was imprisoned in a subterranean chamber amply large\\n\\nenough to have accommodated a dozen or more of the huge animals such as\\n\\nthe one that had dragged him thither.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe realized that he was in the creature’s hidden nest far under the\\n\\nbank of the stream, and that doubtless the only means of ingress or\\n\\negress lay through the submerged opening through which the crocodile\\n\\nhad brought him.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis first thought, of course, was of escape, but that he could make his\\n\\nway to the surface of the river beyond and then to the shore seemed\\n\\nhighly improbable. There might be turns and windings in the neck of the\\n\\npassage, or, most to be feared, he might meet another of the slimy\\n\\ninhabitants of the retreat upon his journey outward.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven should he reach the river in safety, there was still the danger of\\n\\nhis being again attacked before he could effect a safe landing. Still\\n\\nthere was no alternative, and, filling his lungs with the close and\\n\\nreeking air of the chamber, Tarzan of the Apes dived into the dark and\\n\\nwatery hole which he could not see but had felt out and found with his\\n\\nfeet and legs.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe leg which had been held within the jaws of the crocodile was badly\\n\\nlacerated, but the bone had not been broken, nor were the muscles or\\n\\ntendons sufficiently injured to render it useless. It gave him\\n\\nexcruciating pain, that was all.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Tarzan of the Apes was accustomed to pain, and gave it no further\\n\\nthought when he found that the use of his legs was not greatly impaired\\n\\nby the sharp teeth of the monster.\\n\\n\\n\\nRapidly he crawled and swam through the passage which inclined downward\\n\\nand finally upward to open at last into the river bottom but a few feet\\n\\nfrom the shore line. As the ape-man reached the surface he saw the\\n\\nheads of two great crocodiles but a short distance from him. They were\\n\\nmaking rapidly in his direction, and with a superhuman effort the man\\n\\nstruck out for the overhanging branches of a near-by tree.\\n\\n\\n\\nNor was he a moment too soon, for scarcely had he drawn himself to the\\n\\nsafety of the limb than two gaping mouths snapped venomously below him.\\n\\nFor a few minutes Tarzan rested in the tree that had proved the means\\n\\nof his salvation. His eyes scanned the river as far down-stream as the\\n\\ntortuous channel would permit, but there was no sign of the Russian or\\n\\nhis dugout.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen he had rested and bound up his wounded leg he started on in\\n\\npursuit of the drifting canoe. He found himself upon the opposite of\\n\\nthe river to that at which he had entered the stream, but as his quarry\\n\\nwas upon the bosom of the water it made little difference to the\\n\\nape-man upon which side he took up the pursuit.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo his intense chagrin he soon found that his leg was more badly\\n\\ninjured than he had thought, and that its condition seriously impeded\\n\\nhis progress. It was only with the greatest difficulty that he could\\n\\nproceed faster than a walk upon the ground, and in the trees he\\n\\ndiscovered that it not only impeded his progress, but rendered\\n\\ntravelling distinctly dangerous.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom the old negress, Tambudza, Tarzan had gathered a suggestion that\\n\\nnow filled his mind with doubts and misgivings. When the old woman had\\n\\ntold him of the child’s death she had also added that the white woman,\\n\\nthough grief-stricken, had confided to her that the baby was not hers.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan could see no reason for believing that Jane could have found it\\n\\nadvisable to deny her identity or that of the child; the only\\n\\nexplanation that he could put upon the matter was that, after all, the\\n\\nwhite woman who had accompanied his son and the Swede into the jungle\\n\\nfastness of the interior had not been Jane at all.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe more he gave thought to the problem, the more firmly convinced he\\n\\nbecame that his son was dead and his wife still safe in London, and in\\n\\nignorance of the terrible fate that had overtaken her first-born.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter all, then, his interpretation of Rokoff’s sinister taunt had been\\n\\nerroneous, and he had been bearing the burden of a double apprehension\\n\\nneedlessly—at least so thought the ape-man. From this belief he\\n\\ngarnered some slight surcease from the numbing grief that the death of\\n\\nhis little son had thrust upon him.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd such a death! Even the savage beast that was the real Tarzan,\\n\\ninured to the sufferings and horrors of the grim jungle, shuddered as\\n\\nhe contemplated the hideous fate that had overtaken the innocent child.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he made his way painfully towards the coast, he let his mind dwell\\n\\nso constantly upon the frightful crimes which the Russian had\\n\\nperpetrated against his loved ones that the great scar upon his\\n\\nforehead stood out almost continuously in the vivid scarlet that marked\\n\\nthe man’s most relentless and bestial moods of rage. At times he\\n\\nstartled even himself and sent the lesser creatures of the wild jungle\\n\\nscampering to their hiding places as involuntary roars and growls\\n\\nrumbled from his throat.\\n\\n\\n\\nCould he but lay his hand upon the Russian!\\n\\n\\n\\nTwice upon the way to the coast bellicose natives ran threateningly\\n\\nfrom their villages to bar his further progress, but when the awful cry\\n\\nof the bull-ape thundered upon their affrighted ears, and the great\\n\\nwhite giant charged bellowing upon them, they had turned and fled into\\n\\nthe bush, nor ventured thence until he had safely passed.\\n\\n\\n\\nThough his progress seemed tantalizingly slow to the ape-man whose idea\\n\\nof speed had been gained by such standards as the lesser apes attain,\\n\\nhe made, as a matter of fact, almost as rapid progress as the drifting\\n\\ncanoe that bore Rokoff on ahead of him, so that he came to the bay and\\n\\nwithin sight of the ocean just after darkness had fallen upon the same\\n\\nday that Jane Clayton and the Russian ended their flights from the\\n\\ninterior.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe darkness lowered so heavily upon the black river and the encircling\\n\\njungle that Tarzan, even with eyes accustomed to much use after dark,\\n\\ncould make out nothing a few yards from him. His idea was to search the\\n\\nshore that night for signs of the Russian and the woman who he was\\n\\ncertain must have preceded Rokoff down the Ugambi. That the Kincaid or\\n\\nother ship lay at anchor but a hundred yards from him he did not dream,\\n\\nfor no light showed on board the steamer.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven as he commenced his search his attention was suddenly attracted by\\n\\na noise that he had not at first perceived—the stealthy dip of paddles\\n\\nin the water some distance from the shore, and about opposite the point\\n\\nat which he stood. Motionless as a statue he stood listening to the\\n\\nfaint sound.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently it ceased, to be followed by a shuffling noise that the\\n\\nape-man’s trained ears could interpret as resulting from but a single\\n\\ncause—the scraping of leather-shod feet upon the rounds of a ship’s\\n\\nmonkey-ladder. And yet, as far as he could see, there was no ship\\n\\nthere—nor might there be one within a thousand miles.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he stood thus, peering out into the darkness of the cloud-enshrouded\\n\\nnight, there came to him from across the water, like a slap in the\\n\\nface, so sudden and unexpected was it, the sharp staccato of an\\n\\nexchange of shots and then the scream of a woman.\\n\\n\\n\\nWounded though he was, and with the memory of his recent horrible\\n\\nexperience still strong upon him, Tarzan of the Apes did not hesitate\\n\\nas the notes of that frightened cry rose shrill and piercing upon the\\n\\nstill night air. With a bound he cleared the intervening bush—there was\\n\\na splash as the water closed about him—and then, with powerful strokes,\\n\\nhe swam out into the impenetrable night with no guide save the memory\\n\\nof an illusive cry, and for company the hideous denizens of an\\n\\nequatorial river.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe boat that had attracted Jane’s attention as she stood guard upon\\n\\nthe deck of the Kincaid had been perceived by Rokoff upon one bank and\\n\\nMugambi and the horde upon the other. The cries of the Russian had\\n\\nbrought the dugout first to him, and then, after a conference, it had\\n\\nbeen turned toward the Kincaid, but before ever it covered half the\\n\\ndistance between the shore and the steamer a rifle had spoken from the\\n\\nlatter’s deck and one of the sailors in the bow of the canoe had\\n\\ncrumpled and fallen into the water.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter that they went more slowly, and presently, when Jane’s rifle had\\n\\nfound another member of the party, the canoe withdrew to the shore,\\n\\nwhere it lay as long as daylight lasted.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe savage, snarling pack upon the opposite shore had been directed in\\n\\ntheir pursuit by the black warrior, Mugambi, chief of the Wagambi. Only\\n\\nhe knew which might be foe and which friend of their lost master.\\n\\n\\n\\nCould they have reached either the canoe or the Kincaid they would have\\n\\nmade short work of any whom they found there, but the gulf of black\\n\\nwater intervening shut them off from farther advance as effectually as\\n\\nthough it had been the broad ocean that separated them from their prey.\\n\\n\\n\\nMugambi knew something of the occurrences which had led up to the\\n\\nlanding of Tarzan upon Jungle Island and the pursuit of the whites up\\n\\nthe Ugambi. He knew that his savage master sought his wife and child\\n\\nwho had been stolen by the wicked white man whom they had followed far\\n\\ninto the interior and now back to the sea.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe believed also that this same man had killed the great white giant\\n\\nwhom he had come to respect and love as he had never loved the greatest\\n\\nchiefs of his own people. And so in the wild breast of Mugambi burned\\n\\nan iron resolve to win to the side of the wicked one and wreak\\n\\nvengeance upon him for the murder of the ape-man.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut when he saw the canoe come down the river and take in Rokoff, when\\n\\nhe saw it make for the Kincaid, he realized that only by possessing\\n\\nhimself of a canoe could he hope to transport the beasts of the pack\\n\\nwithin striking distance of the enemy.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo it happened that even before Jane Clayton fired the first shot into\\n\\nRokoff’s canoe the beasts of Tarzan had disappeared into the jungle.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter the Russian and his party, which consisted of Paulvitch and the\\n\\nseveral men he had left upon the Kincaid to attend to the matter of\\n\\ncoaling, had retreated before her fire, Jane realized that it would be\\n\\nbut a temporary respite from their attentions which she had gained, and\\n\\nwith the conviction came a determination to make a bold and final\\n\\nstroke for freedom from the menacing threat of Rokoff’s evil purpose.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith this idea in view she opened negotiations with the two sailors she\\n\\nhad imprisoned in the forecastle, and having forced their consent to\\n\\nher plans, upon pain of death should they attempt disloyalty, she\\n\\nreleased them just as darkness closed about the ship.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith ready revolver to compel obedience, she let them up one by one,\\n\\nsearching them carefully for concealed weapons as they stood with hands\\n\\nelevated above their heads. Once satisfied that they were unarmed, she\\n\\nset them to work cutting the cable which held the Kincaid to her\\n\\nanchorage, for her bold plan was nothing less than to set the steamer\\n\\nadrift and float with her out into the open sea, there to trust to the\\n\\nmercy of the elements, which she was confident would be no more\\n\\nmerciless than Nikolas Rokoff should he again capture her.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was, too, the chance that the Kincaid might be sighted by some\\n\\npassing ship, and as she was well stocked with provisions and water—the\\n\\nmen had assured her of this fact—and as the season of storm was well\\n\\nover, she had every reason to hope for the eventual success of her\\n\\nplan.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe night was deeply overcast, heavy clouds riding low above the jungle\\n\\nand the water—only to the west, where the broad ocean spread beyond the\\n\\nriver’s mouth, was there a suggestion of lessening gloom.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a perfect night for the purposes of the work in hand.\\n\\n\\n\\nHer enemies could not see the activity aboard the ship nor mark her\\n\\ncourse as the swift current bore her outward into the ocean. Before\\n\\ndaylight broke the ebb-tide would have carried the Kincaid well into\\n\\nthe Benguela current which flows northward along the coast of Africa,\\n\\nand, as a south wind was prevailing, Jane hoped to be out of sight of\\n\\nthe mouth of the Ugambi before Rokoff could become aware of the\\n\\ndeparture of the steamer.\\n\\n\\n\\nStanding over the labouring seamen, the young woman breathed a sigh of\\n\\nrelief as the last strand of the cable parted and she knew that the\\n\\nvessel was on its way out of the maw of the savage Ugambi.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith her two prisoners still beneath the coercing influence of her\\n\\nrifle, she ordered them upon deck with the intention of again\\n\\nimprisoning them in the forecastle; but at length she permitted herself\\n\\nto be influenced by their promises of loyalty and the arguments which\\n\\nthey put forth that they could be of service to her, and permitted them\\n\\nto remain above.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a few minutes the Kincaid drifted rapidly with the current, and\\n\\nthen, with a grinding jar, she stopped in midstream. The ship had run\\n\\nupon a low-lying bar that splits the channel about a quarter of a mile\\n\\nfrom the sea.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a moment she hung there, and then, swinging round until her bow\\n\\npointed toward the shore, she broke adrift once more.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the same instant, just as Jane Clayton was congratulating herself\\n\\nthat the ship was once more free, there fell upon her ears from a point\\n\\nup the river about where the Kincaid had been anchored the rattle of\\n\\nmusketry and a woman’s scream—shrill, piercing, fear-laden.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sailors heard the shots with certain conviction that they announced\\n\\nthe coming of their employer, and as they had no relish for the plan\\n\\nthat would consign them to the deck of a drifting derelict, they\\n\\nwhispered together a hurried plan to overcome the young woman and hail\\n\\nRokoff and their companions to their rescue.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt seemed that fate would play into their hands, for with the reports\\n\\nof the guns Jane Clayton’s attention had been distracted from her\\n\\nunwilling assistants, and instead of keeping one eye upon them as she\\n\\nhad intended doing, she ran to the bow of the Kincaid to peer through\\n\\nthe darkness toward the source of the disturbance upon the river’s\\n\\nbosom.\\n\\n\\n\\nSeeing that she was off her guard, the two sailors crept stealthily\\n\\nupon her from behind.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe scraping upon the deck of the shoes of one of them startled the\\n\\ngirl to a sudden appreciation of her danger, but the warning had come\\n\\ntoo late.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs she turned, both men leaped upon her and bore her to the deck, and\\n\\nas she went down beneath them she saw, outlined against the lesser\\n\\ngloom of the ocean, the figure of another man clamber over the side of\\n\\nthe Kincaid.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter all her pains her heroic struggle for freedom had failed. With a\\n\\nstifled sob she gave up the unequal battle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII.\\n\\nOn the Deck of the “Kincaid”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Mugambi had turned back into the jungle with the pack he had a\\n\\ndefinite purpose in view. It was to obtain a dugout wherewith to\\n\\ntransport the beasts of Tarzan to the side of the Kincaid. Nor was he\\n\\nlong in coming upon the object which he sought.\\n\\n\\n\\nJust at dusk he found a canoe moored to the bank of a small tributary\\n\\nof the Ugambi at a point where he had felt certain that he should find\\n\\none.\\n\\n\\n\\nWithout loss of time he piled his hideous fellows into the craft and\\n\\nshoved out into the stream. So quickly had they taken possession of the\\n\\ncanoe that the warrior had not noticed that it was already occupied.\\n\\nThe huddled figure sleeping in the bottom had entirely escaped his\\n\\nobservation in the darkness of the night that had now fallen.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut no sooner were they afloat than a savage growling from one of the\\n\\napes directly ahead of him in the dugout attracted his attention to a\\n\\nshivering and cowering figure that trembled between him and the great\\n\\nanthropoid. To Mugambi’s astonishment he saw that it was a native\\n\\nwoman. With difficulty he kept the ape from her throat, and after a\\n\\ntime succeeded in quelling her fears.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt seemed that she had been fleeing from marriage with an old man she\\n\\nloathed and had taken refuge for the night in the canoe she had found\\n\\nupon the river’s edge.\\n\\n\\n\\nMugambi did not wish her presence, but there she was, and rather than\\n\\nlose time by returning her to the shore the black permitted her to\\n\\nremain on board the canoe.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs quickly as his awkward companions could paddle the dugout\\n\\ndown-stream toward the Ugambi and the Kincaid they moved through the\\n\\ndarkness. It was with difficulty that Mugambi could make out the\\n\\nshadowy form of the steamer, but as he had it between himself and the\\n\\nocean it was much more apparent than to one upon either shore of the\\n\\nriver.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he approached it he was amazed to note that it seemed to be receding\\n\\nfrom him, and finally he was convinced that the vessel was moving\\n\\ndown-stream. Just as he was about to urge his creatures to renewed\\n\\nefforts to overtake the steamer the outline of another canoe burst\\n\\nsuddenly into view not three yards from the bow of his own craft.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the same instant the occupants of the stranger discovered the\\n\\nproximity of Mugambi’s horde, but they did not at first recognize the\\n\\nnature of the fearful crew. A man in the bow of the oncoming boat\\n\\nchallenged them just as the two dugouts were about to touch.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor answer came the menacing growl of a panther, and the fellow found\\n\\nhimself gazing into the flaming eyes of Sheeta, who had raised himself\\n\\nwith his forepaws upon the bow of the boat, ready to leap in upon the\\n\\noccupants of the other craft.\\n\\n\\n\\nInstantly Rokoff realized the peril that confronted him and his\\n\\nfellows. He gave a quick command to fire upon the occupants of the\\n\\nother canoe, and it was this volley and the scream of the terrified\\n\\nnative woman in the canoe with Mugambi that both Tarzan and Jane had\\n\\nheard.\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore the slower and less skilled paddlers in Mugambi’s canoe could\\n\\npress their advantage and effect a boarding of the enemy the latter had\\n\\nturned swiftly down-stream and were paddling for their lives in the\\n\\ndirection of the Kincaid, which was now visible to them.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe vessel after striking upon the bar had swung loose again into a\\n\\nslow-moving eddy, which returns up-stream close to the southern shore\\n\\nof the Ugambi only to circle out once more and join the downward flow a\\n\\nhundred yards or so farther up. Thus the Kincaid was returning Jane\\n\\nClayton directly into the hands of her enemies.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt so happened that as Tarzan sprang into the river the vessel was not\\n\\nvisible to him, and as he swam out into the night he had no idea that a\\n\\nship drifted so close at hand. He was guided by the sounds which he\\n\\ncould hear coming from the two canoes.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he swam he had vivid recollections of the last occasion upon which\\n\\nhe had swum in the waters of the Ugambi, and with them a sudden shudder\\n\\nshook the frame of the giant.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut, though he twice felt something brush his legs from the slimy\\n\\ndepths below him, nothing seized him, and of a sudden he quite forgot\\n\\nabout crocodiles in the astonishment of seeing a dark mass loom\\n\\nsuddenly before him where he had still expected to find the open river.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo close was it that a few strokes brought him up to the thing, when to\\n\\nhis amazement his outstretched hand came in contact with a ship’s side.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the agile ape-man clambered over the vessel’s rail there came to his\\n\\nsensitive ears the sound of a struggle at the opposite side of the\\n\\ndeck.\\n\\n\\n\\nNoiselessly he sped across the intervening space.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe moon had risen now, and, though the sky was still banked with\\n\\nclouds, a lesser darkness enveloped the scene than that which had\\n\\nblotted out all sight earlier in the night. His keen eyes, therefore,\\n\\nsaw the figures of two men grappling with a woman.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat it was the woman who had accompanied Anderssen toward the interior\\n\\nhe did not know, though he suspected as much, as he was now quite\\n\\ncertain that this was the deck of the Kincaid upon which chance had led\\n\\nhim.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut he wasted little time in idle speculation. There was a woman in\\n\\ndanger of harm from two ruffians, which was enough excuse for the\\n\\nape-man to project his giant thews into the conflict without further\\n\\ninvestigation.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first that either of the sailors knew that there was a new force at\\n\\nwork upon the ship was the falling of a mighty hand upon a shoulder of\\n\\neach. As if they had been in the grip of a fly-wheel, they were jerked\\n\\nsuddenly from their prey.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What means this?” asked a low voice in their ears.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey were given no time to reply, however, for at the sound of that\\n\\nvoice the young woman had sprung to her feet and with a little cry of\\n\\njoy leaped toward their assailant.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Tarzan!” she cried.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ape-man hurled the two sailors across the deck, where they rolled,\\n\\nstunned and terrified, into the scuppers upon the opposite side, and\\n\\nwith an exclamation of incredulity gathered the girl into his arms.\\n\\n\\n\\nBrief, however, were the moments for their greeting.\\n\\n\\n\\nScarcely had they recognized one another than the clouds above them\\n\\nparted to show the figures of a half-dozen men clambering over the side\\n\\nof the Kincaid to the steamer’s deck.\\n\\n\\n\\nForemost among them was the Russian. As the brilliant rays of the\\n\\nequatorial moon lighted the deck, and he realized that the man before\\n\\nhim was Lord Greystoke, he screamed hysterical commands to his\\n\\nfollowers to fire upon the two.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan pushed Jane behind the cabin near which they had been standing,\\n\\nand with a quick bound started for Rokoff. The men behind the Russian,\\n\\nat least two of them, raised their rifles and fired at the charging\\n\\nape-man; but those behind them were otherwise engaged—for up the\\n\\nmonkey-ladder in their rear was thronging a hideous horde.\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst came five snarling apes, huge, manlike beasts, with bared fangs\\n\\nand slavering jaws; and after them a giant black warrior, his long\\n\\nspear gleaming in the moonlight.\\n\\n\\n\\nBehind him again scrambled another creature, and of all the horrid\\n\\nhorde it was this they most feared—Sheeta, the panther, with gleaming\\n\\njaws agape and fiery eyes blazing at them in the mightiness of his hate\\n\\nand of his blood lust.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe shots that had been fired at Tarzan missed him, and he would have\\n\\nbeen upon Rokoff in another instant had not the great coward dodged\\n\\nbackward between his two henchmen, and, screaming in hysterical terror,\\n\\nbolted forward toward the forecastle.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the moment Tarzan’s attention was distracted by the two men before\\n\\nhim, so that he could not at the time pursue the Russian. About him the\\n\\napes and Mugambi were battling with the balance of the Russian’s party.\\n\\n\\n\\nBeneath the terrible ferocity of the beasts the men were soon\\n\\nscampering in all directions—those who still lived to scamper, for the\\n\\ngreat fangs of the apes of Akut and the tearing talons of Sheeta\\n\\nalready had found more than a single victim.\\n\\n\\n\\nFour, however, escaped and disappeared into the forecastle, where they\\n\\nhoped to barricade themselves against further assault. Here they found\\n\\nRokoff, and, enraged at his desertion of them in their moment of peril,\\n\\nno less than at the uniformly brutal treatment it had been his wont to\\n\\naccord them, they gloated upon the opportunity now offered them to\\n\\nrevenge themselves in part upon their hated employer.\\n\\n\\n\\nDespite his prayers and grovelling pleas, therefore, they hurled him\\n\\nbodily out upon the deck, delivering him to the mercy of the fearful\\n\\nthings from which they had themselves just escaped.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan saw the man emerge from the forecastle—saw and recognized his\\n\\nenemy; but another saw him even as soon.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was Sheeta, and with grinning jaws the mighty beast slunk silently\\n\\ntoward the terror-stricken man.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Rokoff saw what it was that stalked him his shrieks for help\\n\\nfilled the air, as with trembling knees he stood, as one paralyzed,\\n\\nbefore the hideous death that was creeping upon him.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan took a step toward the Russian, his brain burning with a raging\\n\\nfire of vengeance. At last he had the murderer of his son at his mercy.\\n\\nHis was the right to avenge.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce Jane had stayed his hand that time that he sought to take the law\\n\\ninto his own power and mete to Rokoff the death that he had so long\\n\\nmerited; but this time none should stay him.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis fingers clenched and unclenched spasmodically as he approached the\\n\\ntrembling Russ, beastlike and ominous as a brute of prey.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently he saw that Sheeta was about to forestall him, robbing him of\\n\\nthe fruits of his great hate.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe called sharply to the panther, and the words, as if they had broken\\n\\na hideous spell that had held the Russian, galvanized him into sudden\\n\\naction. With a scream he turned and fled toward the bridge.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter him pounced Sheeta the panther, unmindful of his master’s warning\\n\\nvoice.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan was about to leap after the two when he felt a light touch upon\\n\\nhis arm. Turning, he found Jane at his elbow.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do not leave me,” she whispered. “I am afraid.”\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan glanced behind her.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll about were the hideous apes of Akut. Some, even, were approaching\\n\\nthe young woman with bared fangs and menacing guttural warnings.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ape-man warned them back. He had forgotten for the moment that\\n\\nthese were but beasts, unable to differentiate his friends and his\\n\\nfoes. Their savage natures were roused by their recent battle with the\\n\\nsailors, and now all flesh outside the pack was meat to them.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan turned again toward the Russian, chagrined that he should have\\n\\nto forgo the pleasure of personal revenge—unless the man should escape\\n\\nSheeta. But as he looked he saw that there could be no hope of that.\\n\\nThe fellow had retreated to the end of the bridge, where he now stood\\n\\ntrembling and wide-eyed, facing the beast that moved slowly toward him.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe panther crawled with belly to the planking, uttering uncanny\\n\\nmouthings. Rokoff stood as though petrified, his eyes protruding from\\n\\ntheir sockets, his mouth agape, and the cold sweat of terror clammy\\n\\nupon his brow.\\n\\n\\n\\nBelow him, upon the deck, he had seen the great anthropoids, and so had\\n\\nnot dared to seek escape in that direction. In fact, even now one of\\n\\nthe brutes was leaping to seize the bridge-rail and draw himself up to\\n\\nthe Russian’s side.\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore him was the panther, silent and crouched.\\n\\n\\n\\nRokoff could not move. His knees trembled. His voice broke in\\n\\ninarticulate shrieks. With a last piercing wail he sank to his\\n\\nknees—and then Sheeta sprang.\\n\\n\\n\\nFull upon the man’s breast the tawny body hurtled, tumbling the Russian\\n\\nto his back.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the great fangs tore at the throat and chest, Jane Clayton turned\\n\\naway in horror; but not so Tarzan of the Apes. A cold smile of\\n\\nsatisfaction touched his lips. The scar upon his forehead that had\\n\\nburned scarlet faded to the normal hue of his tanned skin and\\n\\ndisappeared.\\n\\n\\n\\nRokoff fought furiously but futilely against the growling, rending fate\\n\\nthat had overtaken him. For all his countless crimes he was punished in\\n\\nthe brief moment of the hideous death that claimed him at the last.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter his struggles ceased Tarzan approached, at Jane’s suggestion, to\\n\\nwrest the body from the panther and give what remained of it decent\\n\\nhuman burial; but the great cat rose snarling above its kill,\\n\\nthreatening even the master it loved in its savage way, so that rather\\n\\nthan kill his friend of the jungle, Tarzan was forced to relinquish his\\n\\nintentions.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll that night Sheeta, the panther, crouched upon the grisly thing that\\n\\nhad been Nikolas Rokoff. The bridge of the Kincaid was slippery with\\n\\nblood. Beneath the brilliant tropic moon the great beast feasted until,\\n\\nwhen the sun rose the following morning, there remained of Tarzan’s\\n\\ngreat enemy only gnawed and broken bones.\\n\\n\\n\\nOf the Russian’s party, all were accounted for except Paulvitch. Four\\n\\nwere prisoners in the Kincaid’s forecastle. The rest were dead.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith these men Tarzan got up steam upon the vessel, and with the\\n\\nknowledge of the mate, who happened to be one of those surviving, he\\n\\nplanned to set out in quest of Jungle Island; but as the morning dawned\\n\\nthere came with it a heavy gale from the west which raised a sea into\\n\\nwhich the mate of the Kincaid dared not venture. All that day the ship\\n\\nlay within the shelter of the mouth of the river; for, though night\\n\\nwitnessed a lessening of the wind, it was thought safer to wait for\\n\\ndaylight before attempting the navigation of the winding channel to the\\n\\nsea.\\n\\n\\n\\nUpon the deck of the steamer the pack wandered without let or hindrance\\n\\nby day, for they had soon learned through Tarzan and Mugambi that they\\n\\nmust harm no one upon the Kincaid; but at night they were confined\\n\\nbelow.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan’s joy had been unbounded when he learned from his wife that the\\n\\nlittle child who had died in the village of M’ganwazam was not their\\n\\nson. Who the baby could have been, or what had become of their own,\\n\\nthey could not imagine, and as both Rokoff and Paulvitch were gone,\\n\\nthere was no way of discovering.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was, however, a certain sense of relief in the knowledge that\\n\\nthey might yet hope. Until positive proof of the baby’s death reached\\n\\nthem there was always that to buoy them up.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt seemed quite evident that their little Jack had not been brought\\n\\naboard the Kincaid. Anderssen would have known of it had such been the\\n\\ncase, but he had assured Jane time and time again that the little one\\n\\nhe had brought to her cabin the night he aided her to escape was the\\n\\nonly one that had been aboard the Kincaid since she lay at Dover.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII.\\n\\nPaulvitch Plots Revenge\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Jane and Tarzan stood upon the vessel’s deck recounting to one\\n\\nanother the details of the various adventures through which each had\\n\\npassed since they had parted in their London home, there glared at them\\n\\nfrom beneath scowling brows a hidden watcher upon the shore.\\n\\n\\n\\nThrough the man’s brain passed plan after plan whereby he might thwart\\n\\nthe escape of the Englishman and his wife, for so long as the vital\\n\\nspark remained within the vindictive brain of Alexander Paulvitch none\\n\\nwho had aroused the enmity of the Russian might be entirely safe.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlan after plan he formed only to discard each either as impracticable,\\n\\nor unworthy the vengeance his wrongs demanded. So warped by faulty\\n\\nreasoning was the criminal mind of Rokoff’s lieutenant that he could\\n\\nnot grasp the real truth of that which lay between himself and the\\n\\nape-man and see that always the fault had been, not with the English\\n\\nlord, but with himself and his confederate.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd at the rejection of each new scheme Paulvitch arrived always at the\\n\\nsame conclusion—that he could accomplish naught while half the breadth\\n\\nof the Ugambi separated him from the object of his hatred.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut how was he to span the crocodile-infested waters? There was no\\n\\ncanoe nearer than the Mosula village, and Paulvitch was none too sure\\n\\nthat the Kincaid would still be at anchor in the river when he returned\\n\\nshould he take the time to traverse the jungle to the distant village\\n\\nand return with a canoe. Yet there was no other way, and so, convinced\\n\\nthat thus alone might he hope to reach his prey, Paulvitch, with a\\n\\nparting scowl at the two figures upon the Kincaid’s deck, turned away\\n\\nfrom the river.\\n\\n\\n\\nHastening through the dense jungle, his mind centred upon his one\\n\\nfetich—revenge—the Russian forgot even his terror of the savage world\\n\\nthrough which he moved.\\n\\n\\n\\nBaffled and beaten at every turn of Fortune’s wheel, reacted upon time\\n\\nafter time by his own malign plotting, the principal victim of his own\\n\\ncriminality, Paulvitch was yet so blind as to imagine that his greatest\\n\\nhappiness lay in a continuation of the plottings and schemings which\\n\\nhad ever brought him and Rokoff to disaster, and the latter finally to\\n\\na hideous death.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the Russian stumbled on through the jungle toward the Mosula village\\n\\nthere presently crystallized within his brain a plan which seemed more\\n\\nfeasible than any that he had as yet considered.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe would come by night to the side of the Kincaid, and once aboard,\\n\\nwould search out the members of the ship’s original crew who had\\n\\nsurvived the terrors of this frightful expedition, and enlist them in\\n\\nan attempt to wrest the vessel from Tarzan and his beasts.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the cabin were arms and ammunition, and hidden in a secret\\n\\nreceptacle in the cabin table was one of those infernal machines, the\\n\\nconstruction of which had occupied much of Paulvitch’s spare time when\\n\\nhe had stood high in the confidence of the Nihilists of his native\\n\\nland.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat was before he had sold them out for immunity and gold to the\\n\\npolice of Petrograd. Paulvitch winced as he recalled the denunciation\\n\\nof him that had fallen from the lips of one of his former comrades ere\\n\\nthe poor devil expiated his political sins at the end of a hempen rope.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the infernal machine was the thing to think of now. He could do\\n\\nmuch with that if he could but get his hands upon it. Within the little\\n\\nhardwood case hidden in the cabin table rested sufficient potential\\n\\ndestructiveness to wipe out in the fraction of a second every enemy\\n\\naboard the Kincaid.\\n\\n\\n\\nPaulvitch licked his lips in anticipatory joy, and urged his tired legs\\n\\nto greater speed that he might not be too late to the ship’s anchorage\\n\\nto carry out his designs.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll depended, of course, upon when the Kincaid departed. The Russian\\n\\nrealized that nothing could be accomplished beneath the light of day.\\n\\nDarkness must shroud his approach to the ship’s side, for should he be\\n\\nsighted by Tarzan or Lady Greystoke he would have no chance to board\\n\\nthe vessel.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe gale that was blowing was, he believed, the cause of the delay in\\n\\ngetting the Kincaid under way, and if it continued to blow until night\\n\\nthen the chances were all in his favour, for he knew that there was\\n\\nlittle likelihood of the ape-man attempting to navigate the tortuous\\n\\nchannel of the Ugambi while darkness lay upon the surface of the water,\\n\\nhiding the many bars and the numerous small islands which are scattered\\n\\nover the expanse of the river’s mouth.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was well after noon when Paulvitch came to the Mosula village upon\\n\\nthe bank of the tributary of the Ugambi. Here he was received with\\n\\nsuspicion and unfriendliness by the native chief, who, like all those\\n\\nwho came in contact with Rokoff or Paulvitch, had suffered in some\\n\\nmanner from the greed, the cruelty, or the lust of the two Muscovites.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Paulvitch demanded the use of a canoe the chief grumbled a surly\\n\\nrefusal and ordered the white man from the village. Surrounded by\\n\\nangry, muttering warriors who seemed to be but waiting some slight\\n\\npretext to transfix him with their menacing spears the Russian could do\\n\\nnaught else than withdraw.\\n\\n\\n\\nA dozen fighting men led him to the edge of the clearing, leaving him\\n\\nwith a warning never to show himself again in the vicinity of their\\n\\nvillage.\\n\\n\\n\\nStifling his anger, Paulvitch slunk into the jungle; but once beyond\\n\\nthe sight of the warriors he paused and listened intently. He could\\n\\nhear the voices of his escort as the men returned to the village, and\\n\\nwhen he was sure that they were not following him he wormed his way\\n\\nthrough the bushes to the edge of the river, still determined some way\\n\\nto obtain a canoe.\\n\\n\\n\\nLife itself depended upon his reaching the Kincaid and enlisting the\\n\\nsurvivors of the ship’s crew in his service, for to be abandoned here\\n\\namidst the dangers of the African jungle where he had won the enmity of\\n\\nthe natives was, he well knew, practically equivalent to a sentence of\\n\\ndeath.\\n\\n\\n\\nA desire for revenge acted as an almost equally powerful incentive to\\n\\nspur him into the face of danger to accomplish his design, so that it\\n\\nwas a desperate man that lay hidden in the foliage beside the little\\n\\nriver searching with eager eyes for some sign of a small canoe which\\n\\nmight be easily handled by a single paddle.\\n\\n\\n\\nNor had the Russian long to wait before one of the awkward little\\n\\nskiffs which the Mosula fashion came in sight upon the bosom of the\\n\\nriver. A youth was paddling lazily out into midstream from a point\\n\\nbeside the village. When he reached the channel he allowed the sluggish\\n\\ncurrent to carry him slowly along while he lolled indolently in the\\n\\nbottom of his crude canoe.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll ignorant of the unseen enemy upon the river’s bank the lad floated\\n\\nslowly down the stream while Paulvitch followed along the jungle path a\\n\\nfew yards behind him.\\n\\n\\n\\nA mile below the village the black boy dipped his paddle into the water\\n\\nand forced his skiff toward the bank. Paulvitch, elated by the chance\\n\\nwhich had drawn the youth to the same side of the river as that along\\n\\nwhich he followed rather than to the opposite side where he would have\\n\\nbeen beyond the stalker’s reach, hid in the brush close beside the\\n\\npoint at which it was evident the skiff would touch the bank of the\\n\\nslow-moving stream, which seemed jealous of each fleeting instant which\\n\\ndrew it nearer to the broad and muddy Ugambi where it must for ever\\n\\nlose its identity in the larger stream that would presently cast its\\n\\nwaters into the great ocean.\\n\\n\\n\\nEqually indolent were the motions of the Mosula youth as he drew his\\n\\nskiff beneath an overhanging limb of a great tree that leaned down to\\n\\nimplant a farewell kiss upon the bosom of the departing water,\\n\\ncaressing with green fronds the soft breast of its languorous love.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd, snake-like, amidst the concealing foliage lay the malevolent Russ.\\n\\nCruel, shifty eyes gloated upon the outlines of the coveted canoe, and\\n\\nmeasured the stature of its owner, while the crafty brain weighed the\\n\\nchances of the white man should physical encounter with the black\\n\\nbecome necessary.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnly direct necessity could drive Alexander Paulvitch to personal\\n\\nconflict; but it was indeed dire necessity which goaded him on to\\n\\naction now.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was time, just time enough, to reach the Kincaid by nightfall.\\n\\nWould the black fool never quit his skiff? Paulvitch squirmed and\\n\\nfidgeted. The lad yawned and stretched. With exasperating\\n\\ndeliberateness he examined the arrows in his quiver, tested his bow,\\n\\nand looked to the edge upon the hunting-knife in his loin-cloth.\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain he stretched and yawned, glanced up at the river-bank, shrugged\\n\\nhis shoulders, and lay down in the bottom of his canoe for a little nap\\n\\nbefore he plunged into the jungle after the prey he had come forth to\\n\\nhunt.\\n\\n\\n\\nPaulvitch half rose, and with tensed muscles stood glaring down upon\\n\\nhis unsuspecting victim. The boy’s lids drooped and closed. Presently\\n\\nhis breast rose and fell to the deep breaths of slumber. The time had\\n\\ncome!\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Russian crept stealthily nearer. A branch rustled beneath his\\n\\nweight and the lad stirred in his sleep. Paulvitch drew his revolver\\n\\nand levelled it upon the black. For a moment he remained in rigid\\n\\nquiet, and then again the youth relapsed into undisturbed slumber.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe white man crept closer. He could not chance a shot until there was\\n\\nno risk of missing. Presently he leaned close above the Mosula. The\\n\\ncold steel of the revolver in his hand insinuated itself nearer and\\n\\nnearer to the breast of the unconscious lad. Now it stopped but a few\\n\\ninches above the strongly beating heart.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the pressure of a finger lay between the harmless boy and eternity.\\n\\nThe soft bloom of youth still lay upon the brown cheek, a smile half\\n\\nparted the beardless lips. Did any qualm of conscience point its\\n\\ndisquieting finger of reproach at the murderer?\\n\\n\\n\\nTo all such was Alexander Paulvitch immune. A sneer curled his bearded\\n\\nlip as his forefinger closed upon the trigger of his revolver. There\\n\\nwas a loud report. A little hole appeared above the heart of the\\n\\nsleeping boy, a little hole about which lay a blackened rim of\\n\\npowder-burned flesh.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe youthful body half rose to a sitting posture. The smiling lips\\n\\ntensed to the nervous shock of a momentary agony which the conscious\\n\\nmind never apprehended, and then the dead sank limply back into that\\n\\ndeepest of slumbers from which there is no awakening.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe killer dropped quickly into the skiff beside the killed. Ruthless\\n\\nhands seized the dead boy heartlessly and raised him to the low\\n\\ngunwale. A little shove, a splash, some widening ripples broken by the\\n\\nsudden surge of a dark, hidden body from the slimy depths, and the\\n\\ncoveted canoe was in the sole possession of the white man—more savage\\n\\nthan the youth whose life he had taken.\\n\\n\\n\\nCasting off the tie rope and seizing the paddle, Paulvitch bent\\n\\nfeverishly to the task of driving the skiff downward toward the Ugambi\\n\\nat top speed.\\n\\n\\n\\nNight had fallen when the prow of the bloodstained craft shot out into\\n\\nthe current of the larger stream. Constantly the Russian strained his\\n\\neyes into the increasing darkness ahead in vain endeavour to pierce the\\n\\nblack shadows which lay between him and the anchorage of the Kincaid.\\n\\n\\n\\nWas the ship still riding there upon the waters of the Ugambi, or had\\n\\nthe ape-man at last persuaded himself of the safety of venturing forth\\n\\ninto the abating storm? As Paulvitch forged ahead with the current he\\n\\nasked himself these questions, and many more beside, not the least\\n\\ndisquieting of which were those which related to his future should it\\n\\nchance that the Kincaid had already steamed away, leaving him to the\\n\\nmerciless horrors of the savage wilderness.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the darkness it seemed to the paddler that he was fairly flying over\\n\\nthe water, and he had become convinced that the ship had left her\\n\\nmoorings and that he had already passed the spot at which she had lain\\n\\nearlier in the day, when there appeared before him beyond a projecting\\n\\npoint which he had but just rounded the flickering light from a ship’s\\n\\nlantern.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlexander Paulvitch could scarce restrain an exclamation of triumph.\\n\\nThe Kincaid had not departed! Life and vengeance were not to elude him\\n\\nafter all.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe stopped paddling the moment that he descried the gleaming beacon of\\n\\nhope ahead of him. Silently he drifted down the muddy waters of the\\n\\nUgambi, occasionally dipping his paddle’s blade gently into the current\\n\\nthat he might guide his primitive craft to the vessel’s side.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he approached more closely the dark bulk of a ship loomed before him\\n\\nout of the blackness of the night. No sound came from the vessel’s\\n\\ndeck. Paulvitch drifted, unseen, close to the Kincaid’s side. Only the\\n\\nmomentary scraping of his canoe’s nose against the ship’s planking\\n\\nbroke the silence of the night.\\n\\n\\n\\nTrembling with nervous excitement, the Russian remained motionless for\\n\\nseveral minutes; but there was no sound from the great bulk above him\\n\\nto indicate that his coming had been noted.\\n\\n\\n\\nStealthily he worked his craft forward until the stays of the bowsprit\\n\\nwere directly above him. He could just reach them. To make his canoe\\n\\nfast there was the work of but a minute or two, and then the man raised\\n\\nhimself quietly aloft.\\n\\n\\n\\nA moment later he dropped softly to the deck. Thoughts of the hideous\\n\\npack which tenanted the ship induced cold tremors along the spine of\\n\\nthe cowardly prowler; but life itself depended upon the success of his\\n\\nventure, and so he was enabled to steel himself to the frightful\\n\\nchances which lay before him.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo sound or sign of watch appeared upon the ship’s deck. Paulvitch\\n\\ncrept stealthily toward the forecastle. All was silence. The hatch was\\n\\nraised, and as the man peered downward he saw one of the Kincaid’s crew\\n\\nreading by the light of the smoky lantern depending from the ceiling of\\n\\nthe crew’s quarters.\\n\\n\\n\\nPaulvitch knew the man well, a surly cut-throat upon whom he figured\\n\\nstrongly in the carrying out of the plan which he had conceived. Gently\\n\\nthe Russ lowered himself through the aperture to the rounds of the\\n\\nladder which led into the forecastle.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe kept his eyes turned upon the reading man, ready to warn him to\\n\\nsilence the moment that the fellow discovered him; but so deeply\\n\\nimmersed was the sailor in the magazine that the Russian came,\\n\\nunobserved, to the forecastle floor.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere he turned and whispered the reader’s name. The man raised his\\n\\neyes from the magazine—eyes that went wide for a moment as they fell\\n\\nupon the familiar countenance of Rokoff’s lieutenant, only to narrow\\n\\ninstantly in a scowl of disapproval.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The devil!” he ejaculated. “Where did you come from? We all thought\\n\\nyou were done for and gone where you ought to have gone a long time\\n\\nago. His lordship will be mighty pleased to see you.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPaulvitch crossed to the sailor’s side. A friendly smile lay on the\\n\\nRussian’s lips, and his right hand was extended in greeting, as though\\n\\nthe other might have been a dear and long lost friend. The sailor\\n\\nignored the proffered hand, nor did he return the other’s smile.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ve come to help you,” explained Paulvitch. “I’m going to help you\\n\\nget rid of the Englishman and his beasts—then there will be no danger\\n\\nfrom the law when we get back to civilization. We can sneak in on them\\n\\nwhile they sleep—that is Greystoke, his wife, and that black scoundrel,\\n\\nMugambi. Afterward it will be a simple matter to clean up the beasts.\\n\\nWhere are they?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“They’re below,” replied the sailor; “but just let me tell you\\n\\nsomething, Paulvitch. You haven’t got no more show to turn us men\\n\\nagainst the Englishman than nothing. We had all we wanted of you and\\n\\nthat other beast. He’s dead, an’ if I don’t miss my guess a whole lot\\n\\nyou’ll be dead too before long. You two treated us like dogs, and if\\n\\nyou think we got any love for you you better forget it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You mean to say that you’re going to turn against me?” demanded\\n\\nPaulvitch.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe other nodded, and then after a momentary pause, during which an\\n\\nidea seemed to have occurred to him, he spoke again.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Unless,” he said, “you can make it worth my while to let you go before\\n\\nthe Englishman finds you here.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You wouldn’t turn me away in the jungle, would you?” asked Paulvitch.\\n\\n“Why, I’d die there in a week.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’d have a chance there,” replied the sailor. “Here, you wouldn’t\\n\\nhave no chance. Why, if I woke up my maties here they’d probably cut\\n\\nyour heart out of you before the Englishman got a chance at you at all.\\n\\nIt’s mighty lucky for you that I’m the one to be awake now and not none\\n\\nof the others.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’re crazy,” cried Paulvitch. “Don’t you know that the Englishman\\n\\nwill have you all hanged when he gets you back where the law can get\\n\\nhold of you?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, he won’t do nothing of the kind,” replied the sailor. “He’s told\\n\\nus as much, for he says that there wasn’t nobody to blame but you and\\n\\nRokoff—the rest of us was just tools. See?”\\n\\n\\n\\nFor half an hour the Russian pleaded or threatened as the mood seized\\n\\nhim. Sometimes he was upon the verge of tears, and again he was\\n\\npromising his listener either fabulous rewards or condign punishment;\\n\\nbut the other was obdurate. [condign: of equal value]\\n\\n\\n\\nHe made it plain to the Russian that there were but two plans open to\\n\\nhim—either he must consent to being turned over immediately to Lord\\n\\nGreystoke, or he must pay to the sailor, as a price for permission to\\n\\nquit the Kincaid unmolested, every cent of money and article of value\\n\\nupon his person and in his cabin.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And you’ll have to make up your mind mighty quick,” growled the man,\\n\\n“for I want to turn in. Come now, choose—his lordship or the jungle?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’ll be sorry for this,” grumbled the Russian.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Shut up,” admonished the sailor. “If you get funny I may change my\\n\\nmind, and keep you here after all.”\\n\\n\\n\\nNow Paulvitch had no intention of permitting himself to fall into the\\n\\nhands of Tarzan of the Apes if he could possibly avoid it, and while\\n\\nthe terrors of the jungle appalled him they were, to his mind,\\n\\ninfinitely preferable to the certain death which he knew he merited and\\n\\nfor which he might look at the hands of the ape-man.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Is anyone sleeping in my cabin?” he asked.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sailor shook his head. “No,” he said; “Lord and Lady Greystoke have\\n\\nthe captain’s cabin. The mate is in his own, and there ain’t no one in\\n\\nyours.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ll go and get my valuables for you,” said Paulvitch.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ll go with you to see that you don’t try any funny business,” said\\n\\nthe sailor, and he followed the Russian up the ladder to the deck.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the cabin entrance the sailor halted to watch, permitting Paulvitch\\n\\nto go alone to his cabin. Here he gathered together his few belongings\\n\\nthat were to buy him the uncertain safety of escape, and as he stood\\n\\nfor a moment beside the little table on which he had piled them he\\n\\nsearched his brain for some feasible plan either to ensure his safety\\n\\nor to bring revenge upon his enemies.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd presently as he thought there recurred to his memory the little\\n\\nblack box which lay hidden in a secret receptacle beneath a false top\\n\\nupon the table where his hand rested.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Russian’s face lighted to a sinister gleam of malevolent\\n\\nsatisfaction as he stooped and felt beneath the table top. A moment\\n\\nlater he withdrew from its hiding-place the thing he sought. He had\\n\\nlighted the lantern swinging from the beams overhead that he might see\\n\\nto collect his belongings, and now he held the black box well in the\\n\\nrays of the lamplight, while he fingered at the clasp that fastened its\\n\\nlid.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe lifted cover revealed two compartments within the box. In one was a\\n\\nmechanism which resembled the works of a small clock. There also was a\\n\\nlittle battery of two dry cells. A wire ran from the clockwork to one\\n\\nof the poles of the battery, and from the other pole through the\\n\\npartition into the other compartment, a second wire returning directly\\n\\nto the clockwork.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhatever lay within the second compartment was not visible, for a cover\\n\\nlay over it and appeared to be sealed in place by asphaltum. In the\\n\\nbottom of the box, beside the clockwork, lay a key, and this Paulvitch\\n\\nnow withdrew and fitted to the winding stem.\\n\\n\\n\\nGently he turned the key, muffling the noise of the winding operation\\n\\nby throwing a couple of articles of clothing over the box. All the time\\n\\nhe listened intently for any sound which might indicate that the sailor\\n\\nor another were approaching his cabin; but none came to interrupt his\\n\\nwork.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the winding was completed the Russian set a pointer upon a small\\n\\ndial at the side of the clockwork, then he replaced the cover upon the\\n\\nblack box, and returned the entire machine to its hiding-place in the\\n\\ntable.\\n\\n\\n\\nA sinister smile curled the man’s bearded lips as he gathered up his\\n\\nvaluables, blew out the lamp, and stepped from his cabin to the side of\\n\\nthe waiting sailor.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Here are my things,” said the Russian; “now let me go.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ll first take a look in your pockets,” replied the sailor. “You\\n\\nmight have overlooked some trifling thing that won’t be of no use to\\n\\nyou in the jungle, but that’ll come in mighty handy to a poor sailorman\\n\\nin London. Ah! just as I feared,” he ejaculated an instant later as he\\n\\nwithdrew a roll of bank-notes from Paulvitch’s inside coat pocket.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Russian scowled, muttering an imprecation; but nothing could be\\n\\ngained by argument, and so he did his best to reconcile himself to his\\n\\nloss in the knowledge that the sailor would never reach London to enjoy\\n\\nthe fruits of his thievery.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was with difficulty that Paulvitch restrained a consuming desire to\\n\\ntaunt the man with a suggestion of the fate that would presently\\n\\novertake him and the other members of the Kincaid’s company; but\\n\\nfearing to arouse the fellow’s suspicions, he crossed the deck and\\n\\nlowered himself in silence into his canoe.\\n\\n\\n\\nA minute or two later he was paddling toward the shore to be swallowed\\n\\nup in the darkness of the jungle night, and the terrors of a hideous\\n\\nexistence from which, could he have had even a slight foreknowledge of\\n\\nwhat awaited him in the long years to come, he would have fled to the\\n\\ncertain death of the open sea rather than endure it.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sailor, having made sure that Paulvitch had departed, returned to\\n\\nthe forecastle, where he hid away his booty and turned into his bunk,\\n\\nwhile in the cabin that had belonged to the Russian there ticked on and\\n\\non through the silences of the night the little mechanism in the small\\n\\nblack box which held for the unconscious sleepers upon the ill-starred\\n\\nKincaid the coming vengeance of the thwarted Russian.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX.\\n\\nThe Last of the “Kincaid”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShortly after the break of day Tarzan was on deck noting the condition\\n\\nof the weather. The wind had abated. The sky was cloudless. Every\\n\\ncondition seemed ideal for the commencement of the return voyage to\\n\\nJungle Island, where the beasts were to be left. And then—home!\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ape-man aroused the mate and gave instructions that the Kincaid\\n\\nsail at the earliest possible moment. The remaining members of the\\n\\ncrew, safe in Lord Greystoke’s assurance that they would not be\\n\\nprosecuted for their share in the villainies of the two Russians,\\n\\nhastened with cheerful alacrity to their several duties.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe beasts, liberated from the confinement of the hold, wandered about\\n\\nthe deck, not a little to the discomfiture of the crew in whose minds\\n\\nthere remained a still vivid picture of the savagery of the beasts in\\n\\nconflict with those who had gone to their deaths beneath the fangs and\\n\\ntalons which even now seemed itching for the soft flesh of further\\n\\nprey.\\n\\n\\n\\nBeneath the watchful eyes of Tarzan and Mugambi, however, Sheeta and\\n\\nthe apes of Akut curbed their desires, so that the men worked about the\\n\\ndeck amongst them in far greater security than they imagined.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt last the Kincaid slipped down the Ugambi and ran out upon the\\n\\nshimmering waters of the Atlantic. Tarzan and Jane Clayton watched the\\n\\nverdure-clad shore-line receding in the ship’s wake, and for once the\\n\\nape-man left his native soil without one single pang of regret.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ship that sailed the seven seas could have borne him away from\\n\\nAfrica to resume his search for his lost boy with half the speed that\\n\\nthe Englishman would have desired, and the slow-moving Kincaid seemed\\n\\nscarce to move at all to the impatient mind of the bereaved father.\\n\\n\\n\\nYet the vessel made progress even when she seemed to be standing still,\\n\\nand presently the low hills of Jungle Island became distinctly visible\\n\\nupon the western horizon ahead.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the cabin of Alexander Paulvitch the thing within the black box\\n\\nticked, ticked, ticked, with apparently unending monotony; but yet,\\n\\nsecond by second, a little arm which protruded from the periphery of\\n\\none of its wheels came nearer and nearer to another little arm which\\n\\nprojected from the hand which Paulvitch had set at a certain point upon\\n\\nthe dial beside the clockwork. When those two arms touched one another\\n\\nthe ticking of the mechanism would cease—for ever.\\n\\n\\n\\nJane and Tarzan stood upon the bridge looking out toward Jungle Island.\\n\\nThe men were forward, also watching the land grow upward out of the\\n\\nocean. The beasts had sought the shade of the galley, where they were\\n\\ncurled up in sleep. All was quiet and peace upon the ship, and upon the\\n\\nwaters.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly, without warning, the cabin roof shot up into the air, a cloud\\n\\nof dense smoke puffed far above the Kincaid, there was a terrific\\n\\nexplosion which shook the vessel from stem to stern.\\n\\n\\n\\nInstantly pandemonium broke loose upon the deck. The apes of Akut,\\n\\nterrified by the sound, ran hither and thither, snarling and growling.\\n\\nSheeta leaped here and there, screaming out his startled terror in\\n\\nhideous cries that sent the ice of fear straight to the hearts of the\\n\\nKincaid’s crew.\\n\\n\\n\\nMugambi, too, was trembling. Only Tarzan of the Apes and his wife\\n\\nretained their composure. Scarce had the debris settled than the\\n\\nape-man was among the beasts, quieting their fears, talking to them in\\n\\nlow, pacific tones, stroking their shaggy bodies, and assuring them, as\\n\\nonly he could, that the immediate danger was over.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn examination of the wreckage showed that their greatest danger, now,\\n\\nlay in fire, for the flames were licking hungrily at the splintered\\n\\nwood of the wrecked cabin, and had already found a foothold upon the\\n\\nlower deck through a great jagged hole which the explosion had opened.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy a miracle no member of the ship’s company had been injured by the\\n\\nblast, the origin of which remained for ever a total mystery to all but\\n\\none—the sailor who knew that Paulvitch had been aboard the Kincaid and\\n\\nin his cabin the previous night. He guessed the truth; but discretion\\n\\nsealed his lips. It would, doubtless, fare none too well for the man\\n\\nwho had permitted the arch enemy of them all aboard the ship in the\\n\\nwatches of the night, where later he might set an infernal machine to\\n\\nblow them all to kingdom come. No, the man decided that he would keep\\n\\nthis knowledge to himself.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the flames gained headway it became apparent to Tarzan that whatever\\n\\nhad caused the explosion had scattered some highly inflammable\\n\\nsubstance upon the surrounding woodwork, for the water which they\\n\\npoured in from the pump seemed rather to spread than to extinguish the\\n\\nblaze.\\n\\n\\n\\nFifteen minutes after the explosion great, black clouds of smoke were\\n\\nrising from the hold of the doomed vessel. The flames had reached the\\n\\nengine-room, and the ship no longer moved toward the shore. Her fate\\n\\nwas as certain as though the waters had already closed above her\\n\\ncharred and smoking remains.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is useless to remain aboard her longer,” remarked the ape-man to\\n\\nthe mate. “There is no telling but there may be other explosions, and\\n\\nas we cannot hope to save her, the safest thing which we can do is to\\n\\ntake to the boats without further loss of time and make land.”\\n\\n\\n\\nNor was there other alternative. Only the sailors could bring away any\\n\\nbelongings, for the fire, which had not yet reached the forecastle, had\\n\\nconsumed all in the vicinity of the cabin which the explosion had not\\n\\ndestroyed.\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo boats were lowered, and as there was no sea the landing was made\\n\\nwith infinite ease. Eager and anxious, the beasts of Tarzan sniffed the\\n\\nfamiliar air of their native island as the small boats drew in toward\\n\\nthe beach, and scarce had their keels grated upon the sand than Sheeta\\n\\nand the apes of Akut were over the bows and racing swiftly toward the\\n\\njungle. A half-sad smile curved the lips of the ape-man as he watched\\n\\nthem go.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Good-bye, my friends,” he murmured. “You have been good and faithful\\n\\nallies, and I shall miss you.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“They will return, will they not, dear?” asked Jane Clayton, at his\\n\\nside.\\n\\n\\n\\n“They may and they may not,” replied the ape-man. “They have been ill\\n\\nat ease since they were forced to accept so many human beings into\\n\\ntheir confidence. Mugambi and I alone affected them less, for he and I\\n\\nare, at best, but half human. You, however, and the members of the crew\\n\\nare far too civilized for my beasts—it is you whom they are fleeing.\\n\\nDoubtless they feel that they cannot trust themselves in the close\\n\\nvicinity of so much perfectly good food without the danger that they\\n\\nmay help themselves to a mouthful some time by mistake.”\\n\\n\\n\\nJane laughed. “I think they are just trying to escape you,” she\\n\\nretorted. “You are always making them stop something which they see no\\n\\nreason why they should not do. Like little children they are doubtless\\n\\ndelighted at this opportunity to flee from the zone of parental\\n\\ndiscipline. If they come back, though, I hope they won’t come by\\n\\nnight.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Or come hungry, eh?” laughed Tarzan.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor two hours after landing the little party stood watching the burning\\n\\nship which they had abandoned. Then there came faintly to them from\\n\\nacross the water the sound of a second explosion. The Kincaid settled\\n\\nrapidly almost immediately thereafter, and sank within a few minutes.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe cause of the second explosion was less a mystery than that of the\\n\\nfirst, the mate attributing it to the bursting of the boilers when the\\n\\nflames had finally reached them; but what had caused the first\\n\\nexplosion was a subject of considerable speculation among the stranded\\n\\ncompany.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX.\\n\\nJungle Island Again\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first consideration of the party was to locate fresh water and make\\n\\ncamp, for all knew that their term of existence upon Jungle Island\\n\\nmight be drawn out to months, or even years.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan knew the nearest water, and to this he immediately led the\\n\\nparty. Here the men fell to work to construct shelters and rude\\n\\nfurniture while Tarzan went into the jungle after meat, leaving the\\n\\nfaithful Mugambi and the Mosula woman to guard Jane, whose safety he\\n\\nwould never trust to any member of the Kincaid’s cut-throat crew.\\n\\n\\n\\nLady Greystoke suffered far greater anguish than any other of the\\n\\ncastaways, for the blow to her hopes and her already cruelly lacerated\\n\\nmother-heart lay not in her own privations but in the knowledge that\\n\\nshe might now never be able to learn the fate of her first-born or do\\n\\naught to discover his whereabouts, or ameliorate his condition—a\\n\\ncondition which imagination naturally pictured in the most frightful\\n\\nforms.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor two weeks the party divided the time amongst the various duties\\n\\nwhich had been allotted to each. A daylight watch was maintained from\\n\\nsunrise to sunset upon a bluff near the camp—a jutting shoulder of rock\\n\\nwhich overlooked the sea. Here, ready for instant lighting, was\\n\\ngathered a huge pile of dry branches, while from a lofty pole which\\n\\nthey had set in the ground there floated an improvised distress signal\\n\\nfashioned from a red undershirt which belonged to the mate of the\\n\\nKincaid.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut never a speck upon the horizon that might be sail or smoke rewarded\\n\\nthe tired eyes that in their endless, hopeless vigil strained daily out\\n\\nacross the vast expanse of ocean.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was Tarzan who suggested, finally, that they attempt to construct a\\n\\nvessel that would bear them back to the mainland. He alone could show\\n\\nthem how to fashion rude tools, and when the idea had taken root in the\\n\\nminds of the men they were eager to commence their labours.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut as time went on and the Herculean nature of their task became more\\n\\nand more apparent they fell to grumbling, and to quarrelling among\\n\\nthemselves, so that to the other dangers were now added dissension and\\n\\nsuspicion.\\n\\n\\n\\nMore than before did Tarzan now fear to leave Jane among the half\\n\\nbrutes of the Kincaid’s crew; but hunting he must do, for none other\\n\\ncould so surely go forth and return with meat as he. Sometimes Mugambi\\n\\nspelled him at the hunting; but the black’s spear and arrows were never\\n\\nso sure of results as the rope and knife of the ape-man.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally the men shirked their work, going off into the jungle by twos\\n\\nto explore and to hunt. All this time the camp had had no sight of\\n\\nSheeta, or Akut and the other great apes, though Tarzan had sometimes\\n\\nmet them in the jungle as he hunted.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd as matters tended from bad to worse in the camp of the castaways\\n\\nupon the east coast of Jungle Island, another camp came into being upon\\n\\nthe north coast.\\n\\n\\n\\nHere, in a little cove, lay a small schooner, the Cowrie, whose decks\\n\\nhad but a few days since run red with the blood of her officers and the\\n\\nloyal members of her crew, for the Cowrie had fallen upon bad days when\\n\\nit had shipped such men as Gust and Momulla the Maori and that\\n\\narch-fiend Kai Shang of Fachan.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere were others, too, ten of them all told, the scum of the South Sea\\n\\nports; but Gust and Momulla and Kai Shang were the brains and cunning\\n\\nof the company. It was they who had instigated the mutiny that they\\n\\nmight seize and divide the catch of pearls which constituted the wealth\\n\\nof the Cowrie’s cargo.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was Kai Shang who had murdered the captain as he lay asleep in his\\n\\nberth, and it had been Momulla the Maori who had led the attack upon\\n\\nthe officer of the watch.\\n\\n\\n\\nGust, after his own peculiar habit, had found means to delegate to the\\n\\nothers the actual taking of life. Not that Gust entertained any\\n\\nscruples on the subject, other than those which induced in him a rare\\n\\nregard for his own personal safety. There is always a certain element\\n\\nof risk to the assassin, for victims of deadly assault are seldom prone\\n\\nto die quietly and considerately. There is always a certain element of\\n\\nrisk to go so far as to dispute the issue with the murderer. It was\\n\\nthis chance of dispute which Gust preferred to forgo.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut now that the work was done the Swede aspired to the position of\\n\\nhighest command among the mutineers. He had even gone so far as to\\n\\nappropriate and wear certain articles belonging to the murdered captain\\n\\nof the Cowrie—articles of apparel which bore upon them the badges and\\n\\ninsignia of authority.\\n\\n\\n\\nKai Shang was peeved. He had no love for authority, and certainly not\\n\\nthe slightest intention of submitting to the domination of an ordinary\\n\\nSwede sailor.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe seeds of discontent were, therefore, already planted in the camp of\\n\\nthe mutineers of the Cowrie at the north edge of Jungle Island. But Kai\\n\\nShang realized that he must act with circumspection, for Gust alone of\\n\\nthe motley horde possessed sufficient knowledge of navigation to get\\n\\nthem out of the South Atlantic and around the cape into more congenial\\n\\nwaters where they might find a market for their ill-gotten wealth, and\\n\\nno questions asked.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe day before they sighted Jungle Island and discovered the little\\n\\nland-locked harbour upon the bosom of which the Cowrie now rode quietly\\n\\nat anchor, the watch had discovered the smoke and funnels of a warship\\n\\nupon the southern horizon.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe chance of being spoken to and investigated by a man-of-war appealed\\n\\nnot at all to any of them, so they put into hiding for a few days until\\n\\nthe danger should have passed.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd now Gust did not wish to venture out to sea again. There was no\\n\\ntelling, he insisted, but that the ship they had seen was actually\\n\\nsearching for them. Kai Shang pointed out that such could not be the\\n\\ncase since it was impossible for any human being other than themselves\\n\\nto have knowledge of what had transpired aboard the Cowrie.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Gust was not to be persuaded. In his wicked heart he nursed a\\n\\nscheme whereby he might increase his share of the booty by something\\n\\nlike one hundred per cent. He alone could sail the Cowrie, therefore\\n\\nthe others could not leave Jungle Island without him; but what was\\n\\nthere to prevent Gust, with just sufficient men to man the schooner,\\n\\nslipping away from Kai Shang, Momulla the Maori, and some half of the\\n\\ncrew when opportunity presented?\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was for this opportunity that Gust waited. Some day there would come\\n\\na moment when Kai Shang, Momulla, and three or four of the others would\\n\\nbe absent from camp, exploring or hunting. The Swede racked his brain\\n\\nfor some plan whereby he might successfully lure from the sight of the\\n\\nanchored ship those whom he had determined to abandon.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo this end he organized hunting party after hunting party, but always\\n\\nthe devil of perversity seemed to enter the soul of Kai Shang, so that\\n\\nwily celestial would never hunt except in the company of Gust himself.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne day Kai Shang spoke secretly with Momulla the Maori, pouring into\\n\\nthe brown ear of his companion the suspicions which he harboured\\n\\nconcerning the Swede. Momulla was for going immediately and running a\\n\\nlong knife through the heart of the traitor.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is true that Kai Shang had no other evidence than the natural\\n\\ncunning of his own knavish soul—but he imagined in the intentions of\\n\\nGust what he himself would have been glad to accomplish had the means\\n\\nlain at hand.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut he dared not let Momulla slay the Swede, upon whom they depended to\\n\\nguide them to their destination. They decided, however, that it would\\n\\ndo no harm to attempt to frighten Gust into acceding to their demands,\\n\\nand with this purpose in mind the Maori sought out the self-constituted\\n\\ncommander of the party.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen he broached the subject of immediate departure Gust again raised\\n\\nhis former objection—that the warship might very probably be patrolling\\n\\nthe sea directly in their southern path, waiting for them to make the\\n\\nattempt to reach other waters.\\n\\n\\n\\nMomulla scoffed at the fears of his fellow, pointing out that as no one\\n\\naboard any warship knew of their mutiny there could be no reason why\\n\\nthey should be suspected.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah!” exclaimed Gust, “there is where you are wrong. There is where you\\n\\nare lucky that you have an educated man like me to tell you what to do.\\n\\nYou are an ignorant savage, Momulla, and so you know nothing of\\n\\nwireless.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Maori leaped to his feet and laid his hand upon the hilt of his\\n\\nknife.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I am no savage,” he shouted.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I was only joking,” the Swede hastened to explain. “We are old\\n\\nfriends, Momulla; we cannot afford to quarrel, at least not while old\\n\\nKai Shang is plotting to steal all the pearls from us. If he could find\\n\\na man to navigate the Cowrie he would leave us in a minute. All his\\n\\ntalk about getting away from here is just because he has some scheme in\\n\\nhis head to get rid of us.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“But the wireless,” asked Momulla. “What has the wireless to do with\\n\\nour remaining here?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh yes,” replied Gust, scratching his head. He was wondering if the\\n\\nMaori were really so ignorant as to believe the preposterous lie he was\\n\\nabout to unload upon him. “Oh yes! You see every warship is equipped\\n\\nwith what they call a wireless apparatus. It lets them talk to other\\n\\nships hundreds of miles away, and it lets them listen to all that is\\n\\nsaid on these other ships. Now, you see, when you fellows were shooting\\n\\nup the Cowrie you did a whole lot of loud talking, and there isn’t any\\n\\ndoubt but that that warship was a-lyin’ off south of us listenin’ to it\\n\\nall. Of course they might not have learned the name of the ship, but\\n\\nthey heard enough to know that the crew of some ship was mutinying and\\n\\nkillin’ her officers. So you see they’ll be waiting to search every\\n\\nship they sight for a long time to come, and they may not be far away\\n\\nnow.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen he had ceased speaking the Swede strove to assume an air of\\n\\ncomposure that his listener might not have his suspicions aroused as to\\n\\nthe truth of the statements that had just been made.\\n\\n\\n\\nMomulla sat for some time in silence, eyeing Gust. At last he rose.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are a great liar,” he said. “If you don’t get us on our way by\\n\\ntomorrow you’ll never have another chance to lie, for I heard two of\\n\\nthe men saying that they’d like to run a knife into you and that if you\\n\\nkept them in this hole any longer they’d do it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Go and ask Kai Shang if there is not a wireless,” replied Gust. “He\\n\\nwill tell you that there is such a thing and that vessels can talk to\\n\\none another across hundreds of miles of water. Then say to the two men\\n\\nwho wish to kill me that if they do so they will never live to spend\\n\\ntheir share of the swag, for only I can get you safely to any port.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Momulla went to Kai Shang and asked him if there was such an\\n\\napparatus as a wireless by means of which ships could talk with each\\n\\nother at great distances, and Kai Shang told him that there was.\\n\\n\\n\\nMomulla was puzzled; but still he wished to leave the island, and was\\n\\nwilling to take his chances on the open sea rather than to remain\\n\\nlonger in the monotony of the camp.\\n\\n\\n\\n“If we only had someone else who could navigate a ship!” wailed Kai\\n\\nShang.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat afternoon Momulla went hunting with two other Maoris. They hunted\\n\\ntoward the south, and had not gone far from camp when they were\\n\\nsurprised by the sound of voices ahead of them in the jungle.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey knew that none of their own men had preceded them, and as all were\\n\\nconvinced that the island was uninhabited, they were inclined to flee\\n\\nin terror on the hypothesis that the place was haunted—possibly by the\\n\\nghosts of the murdered officers and men of the Cowrie.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Momulla was even more curious than he was superstitious, and so he\\n\\nquelled his natural desire to flee from the supernatural. Motioning his\\n\\ncompanions to follow his example, he dropped to his hands and knees,\\n\\ncrawling forward stealthily and with quakings of heart through the\\n\\njungle in the direction from which came the voices of the unseen\\n\\nspeakers.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently, at the edge of a little clearing, he halted, and there he\\n\\nbreathed a deep sigh of relief, for plainly before him he saw two\\n\\nflesh-and-blood men sitting upon a fallen log and talking earnestly\\n\\ntogether.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne was Schneider, mate of the Kincaid, and the other was a seaman\\n\\nnamed Schmidt.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I think we can do it, Schmidt,” Schneider was saying. “A good canoe\\n\\nwouldn’t be hard to build, and three of us could paddle it to the\\n\\nmainland in a day if the wind was right and the sea reasonably calm.\\n\\nThere ain’t no use waiting for the men to build a big enough boat to\\n\\ntake the whole party, for they’re sore now and sick of working like\\n\\nslaves all day long. It ain’t none of our business anyway to save the\\n\\nEnglishman. Let him look out for himself, says I.” He paused for a\\n\\nmoment, and then eyeing the other to note the effect of his next words,\\n\\nhe continued, “But we might take the woman. It would be a shame to\\n\\nleave a nice-lookin’ piece like she is in such a Gott-forsaken hole as\\n\\nthis here island.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSchmidt looked up and grinned.\\n\\n\\n\\n“So that’s how she’s blowin’, is it?” he asked. “Why didn’t you say so\\n\\nin the first place? Wot’s in it for me if I help you?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“She ought to pay us well to get her back to civilization,” explained\\n\\nSchneider, “an’ I tell you what I’ll do. I’ll just whack up with the\\n\\ntwo men that helps me. I’ll take half an’ they can divide the other\\n\\nhalf—you an’ whoever the other bloke is. I’m sick of this place, an’\\n\\nthe sooner I get out of it the better I’ll like it. What do you say?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Suits me,” replied Schmidt. “I wouldn’t know how to reach the mainland\\n\\nmyself, an’ know that none o’ the other fellows would, so’s you’re the\\n\\nonly one that knows anything of navigation you’re the fellow I’ll tie\\n\\nto.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMomulla the Maori pricked up his ears. He had a smattering of every\\n\\ntongue that is spoken upon the seas, and more than a few times had he\\n\\nsailed on English ships, so that he understood fairly well all that had\\n\\npassed between Schneider and Schmidt since he had stumbled upon them.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe rose to his feet and stepped into the clearing. Schneider and his\\n\\ncompanion started as nervously as though a ghost had risen before them.\\n\\nSchneider reached for his revolver. Momulla raised his right hand, palm\\n\\nforward, as a sign of his pacific intentions.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I am a friend,” he said. “I heard you; but do not fear that I will\\n\\nreveal what you have said. I can help you, and you can help me.” He was\\n\\naddressing Schneider. “You can navigate a ship, but you have no ship.\\n\\nWe have a ship, but no one to navigate it. If you will come with us and\\n\\nask no questions we will let you take the ship where you will after you\\n\\nhave landed us at a certain port, the name of which we will give you\\n\\nlater. You can take the woman of whom you speak, and we will ask no\\n\\nquestions either. Is it a bargain?”\\n\\n\\n\\nSchneider desired more information, and got as much as Momulla thought\\n\\nbest to give him. Then the Maori suggested that they speak with Kai\\n\\nShang. The two members of the Kincaid’s company followed Momulla and\\n\\nhis fellows to a point in the jungle close by the camp of the\\n\\nmutineers. Here Momulla hid them while he went in search of Kai Shang,\\n\\nfirst admonishing his Maori companions to stand guard over the two\\n\\nsailors lest they change their minds and attempt to escape. Schneider\\n\\nand Schmidt were virtually prisoners, though they did not know it.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently Momulla returned with Kai Shang, to whom he had briefly\\n\\nnarrated the details of the stroke of good fortune that had come to\\n\\nthem. The Chinaman spoke at length with Schneider, until,\\n\\nnotwithstanding his natural suspicion of the sincerity of all men, he\\n\\nbecame quite convinced that Schneider was quite as much a rogue as\\n\\nhimself and that the fellow was anxious to leave the island.\\n\\n\\n\\nThese two premises accepted there could be little doubt that Schneider\\n\\nwould prove trustworthy in so far as accepting the command of the\\n\\nCowrie was concerned; after that Kai Shang knew that he could find\\n\\nmeans to coerce the man into submission to his further wishes.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Schneider and Schmidt left them and set out in the direction of\\n\\ntheir own camp, it was with feelings of far greater relief than they\\n\\nhad experienced in many a day. Now at last they saw a feasible plan for\\n\\nleaving the island upon a seaworthy craft. There would be no more hard\\n\\nlabour at ship-building, and no risking their lives upon a crudely\\n\\nbuilt makeshift that would be quite as likely to go to the bottom as it\\n\\nwould to reach the mainland.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso, they were to have assistance in capturing the woman, or rather\\n\\nwomen, for when Momulla had learned that there was a black woman in the\\n\\nother camp he had insisted that she be brought along as well as the\\n\\nwhite woman.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Kai Shang and Momulla entered their camp, it was with a realization\\n\\nthat they no longer needed Gust. They marched straight to the tent in\\n\\nwhich they might expect to find him at that hour of the day, for though\\n\\nit would have been more comfortable for the entire party to remain\\n\\naboard the ship, they had mutually decided that it would be safer for\\n\\nall concerned were they to pitch their camp ashore.\\n\\n\\n\\nEach knew that in the heart of the others was sufficient treachery to\\n\\nmake it unsafe for any member of the party to go ashore leaving the\\n\\nothers in possession of the Cowrie, so not more than two or three men\\n\\nat a time were ever permitted aboard the vessel unless all the balance\\n\\nof the company was there too.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the two crossed toward Gust’s tent the Maori felt the edge of his\\n\\nlong knife with one grimy, calloused thumb. The Swede would have felt\\n\\nfar from comfortable could he have seen this significant action, or\\n\\nread what was passing amid the convolutions of the brown man’s cruel\\n\\nbrain.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow it happened that Gust was at that moment in the tent occupied by\\n\\nthe cook, and this tent stood but a few feet from his own. So that he\\n\\nheard the approach of Kai Shang and Momulla, though he did not, of\\n\\ncourse, dream that it had any special significance for him.\\n\\n\\n\\nChance had it, though, that he glanced out of the doorway of the cook’s\\n\\ntent at the very moment that Kai Shang and Momulla approached the\\n\\nentrance to his, and he thought that he noted a stealthiness in their\\n\\nmovements that comported poorly with amicable or friendly intentions,\\n\\nand then, just as they two slunk within the interior, Gust caught a\\n\\nglimpse of the long knife which Momulla the Maori was then carrying\\n\\nbehind his back.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Swede’s eyes opened wide, and a funny little sensation assailed the\\n\\nroots of his hairs. Also he turned almost white beneath his tan. Quite\\n\\nprecipitately he left the cook’s tent. He was not one who required a\\n\\ndetailed exposition of intentions that were quite all too obvious.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs surely as though he had heard them plotting, he knew that Kai Shang\\n\\nand Momulla had come to take his life. The knowledge that he alone\\n\\ncould navigate the Cowrie had, up to now, been sufficient assurance of\\n\\nhis safety; but quite evidently something had occurred of which he had\\n\\nno knowledge that would make it quite worth the while of his\\n\\nco-conspirators to eliminate him.\\n\\n\\n\\nWithout a pause Gust darted across the beach and into the jungle. He\\n\\nwas afraid of the jungle; uncanny noises that were indeed frightful\\n\\ncame forth from its recesses—the tangled mazes of the mysterious\\n\\ncountry back of the beach.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut if Gust was afraid of the jungle he was far more afraid of Kai\\n\\nShang and Momulla. The dangers of the jungle were more or less\\n\\nproblematical, while the danger that menaced him at the hands of his\\n\\ncompanions was a perfectly well-known quantity, which might be\\n\\nexpressed in terms of a few inches of cold steel, or the coil of a\\n\\nlight rope. He had seen Kai Shang garrotte a man at Pai-sha in a dark\\n\\nalleyway back of Loo Kotai’s place. He feared the rope, therefore, more\\n\\nthan he did the knife of the Maori; but he feared them both too much to\\n\\nremain within reach of either. Therefore he chose the pitiless jungle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI.\\n\\nThe Law of the Jungle\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn Tarzan’s camp, by dint of threats and promised rewards, the ape-man\\n\\nhad finally succeeded in getting the hull of a large skiff almost\\n\\ncompleted. Much of the work he and Mugambi had done with their own\\n\\nhands in addition to furnishing the camp with meat.\\n\\n\\n\\nSchneider, the mate, had been doing considerable grumbling, and had at\\n\\nlast openly deserted the work and gone off into the jungle with Schmidt\\n\\nto hunt. He said that he wanted a rest, and Tarzan, rather than add to\\n\\nthe unpleasantness which already made camp life almost unendurable, had\\n\\npermitted the two men to depart without a remonstrance.\\n\\n\\n\\nUpon the following day, however, Schneider affected a feeling of\\n\\nremorse for his action, and set to work with a will upon the skiff.\\n\\nSchmidt also worked good-naturedly, and Lord Greystoke congratulated\\n\\nhimself that at last the men had awakened to the necessity for the\\n\\nlabour which was being asked of them and to their obligations to the\\n\\nbalance of the party.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was with a feeling of greater relief than he had experienced for\\n\\nmany a day that he set out that noon to hunt deep in the jungle for a\\n\\nherd of small deer which Schneider reported that he and Schmidt had\\n\\nseen there the day before.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe direction in which Schneider had reported seeing the deer was\\n\\ntoward the south-west, and to that point the ape-man swung easily\\n\\nthrough the tangled verdure of the forest.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd as he went there approached from the north a half-dozen\\n\\nill-featured men who went stealthily through the jungle as go men bent\\n\\nupon the commission of a wicked act.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey thought that they travelled unseen; but behind them, almost from\\n\\nthe moment they quitted their own camp, a tall man crept upon their\\n\\ntrail. In the man’s eyes were hate and fear, and a great curiosity. Why\\n\\nwent Kai Shang and Momulla and the others thus stealthily toward the\\n\\nsouth? What did they expect to find there? Gust shook his low-browed\\n\\nhead in perplexity. But he would know. He would follow them and learn\\n\\ntheir plans, and then if he could thwart them he would—that went\\n\\nwithout question.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt first he had thought that they searched for him; but finally his\\n\\nbetter judgment assured him that such could not be the case, since they\\n\\nhad accomplished all they really desired by chasing him out of camp.\\n\\nNever would Kai Shang or Momulla go to such pains to slay him or\\n\\nanother unless it would put money into their pockets, and as Gust had\\n\\nno money it was evident that they were searching for someone else.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently the party he trailed came to a halt. Its members concealed\\n\\nthemselves in the foliage bordering the game trail along which they had\\n\\ncome. Gust, that he might the better observe, clambered into the\\n\\nbranches of a tree to the rear of them, being careful that the leafy\\n\\nfronds hid him from the view of his erstwhile mates.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had not long to wait before he saw a strange white man approach\\n\\ncarefully along the trail from the south.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt sight of the new-comer Momulla and Kai Shang arose from their places\\n\\nof concealment and greeted him. Gust could not overhear what passed\\n\\nbetween them. Then the man returned in the direction from which he had\\n\\ncome.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was Schneider. Nearing his camp he circled to the opposite side of\\n\\nit, and presently came running in breathlessly. Excitedly he hastened\\n\\nto Mugambi.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Quick!” he cried. “Those apes of yours have caught Schmidt and will\\n\\nkill him if we do not hasten to his aid. You alone can call them off.\\n\\nTake Jones and Sullivan—you may need help—and get to him as quick as\\n\\nyou can. Follow the game trail south for about a mile. I will remain\\n\\nhere. I am too spent with running to go back with you,” and the mate of\\n\\nthe Kincaid threw himself upon the ground, panting as though he was\\n\\nalmost done for.\\n\\n\\n\\nMugambi hesitated. He had been left to guard the two women. He did not\\n\\nknow what to do, and then Jane Clayton, who had heard Schneider’s\\n\\nstory, added her pleas to those of the mate.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do not delay,” she urged. “We shall be all right here. Mr. Schneider\\n\\nwill remain with us. Go, Mugambi. The poor fellow must be saved.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSchmidt, who lay hidden in a bush at the edge of the camp, grinned.\\n\\nMugambi, heeding the commands of his mistress, though still doubtful of\\n\\nthe wisdom of his action, started off toward the south, with Jones and\\n\\nSullivan at his heels.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo sooner had he disappeared than Schmidt rose and darted north into\\n\\nthe jungle, and a few minutes later the face of Kai Shang of Fachan\\n\\nappeared at the edge of the clearing. Schneider saw the Chinaman, and\\n\\nmotioned to him that the coast was clear.\\n\\n\\n\\nJane Clayton and the Mosula woman were sitting at the opening of the\\n\\nformer’s tent, their backs toward the approaching ruffians. The first\\n\\nintimation that either had of the presence of strangers in camp was the\\n\\nsudden appearance of a half-dozen ragged villains about them.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come!” said Kai Shang, motioning that the two arise and follow him.\\n\\n\\n\\nJane Clayton sprang to her feet and looked about for Schneider, only to\\n\\nsee him standing behind the newcomers, a grin upon his face. At his\\n\\nside stood Schmidt. Instantly she saw that she had been made the victim\\n\\nof a plot.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What is the meaning of this?” she asked, addressing the mate.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It means that we have found a ship and that we can now escape from\\n\\nJungle Island,” replied the man.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why did you send Mugambi and the others into the jungle?” she\\n\\ninquired.\\n\\n\\n\\n“They are not coming with us—only you and I, and the Mosula woman.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come!” repeated Kai Shang, and seized Jane Clayton’s wrist.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the Maoris grasped the black woman by the arm, and when she\\n\\nwould have screamed struck her across the mouth.\\n\\n\\n\\nMugambi raced through the jungle toward the south. Jones and Sullivan\\n\\ntrailed far behind. For a mile he continued upon his way to the relief\\n\\nof Schmidt, but no signs saw he of the missing man or of any of the\\n\\napes of Akut.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt last he halted and called aloud the summons which he and Tarzan had\\n\\nused to hail the great anthropoids. There was no response. Jones and\\n\\nSullivan came up with the black warrior as the latter stood voicing his\\n\\nweird call. For another half-mile the black searched, calling\\n\\noccasionally.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally the truth flashed upon him, and then, like a frightened deer,\\n\\nhe wheeled and dashed back toward camp. Arriving there, it was but a\\n\\nmoment before full confirmation of his fears was impressed upon him.\\n\\nLady Greystoke and the Mosula woman were gone. So, likewise, was\\n\\nSchneider.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Jones and Sullivan joined Mugambi he would have killed them in his\\n\\nanger, thinking them parties to the plot; but they finally succeeded in\\n\\npartially convincing him that they had known nothing of it.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs they stood speculating upon the probable whereabouts of the women\\n\\nand their abductor, and the purpose which Schneider had in mind in\\n\\ntaking them from camp, Tarzan of the Apes swung from the branches of a\\n\\ntree and crossed the clearing toward them.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis keen eyes detected at once that something was radically wrong, and\\n\\nwhen he had heard Mugambi’s story his jaws clicked angrily together as\\n\\nhe knitted his brows in thought.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat could the mate hope to accomplish by taking Jane Clayton from a\\n\\ncamp upon a small island from which there was no escape from the\\n\\nvengeance of Tarzan? The ape-man could not believe the fellow such a\\n\\nfool, and then a slight realization of the truth dawned upon him.\\n\\n\\n\\nSchneider would not have committed such an act unless he had been\\n\\nreasonably sure that there was a way by which he could quit Jungle\\n\\nIsland with his prisoners. But why had he taken the black woman as\\n\\nwell? There must have been others, one of whom wanted the dusky female.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come,” said Tarzan, “there is but one thing to do now, and that is to\\n\\nfollow the trail.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he finished speaking a tall, ungainly figure emerged from the jungle\\n\\nnorth of the camp. He came straight toward the four men. He was an\\n\\nentire stranger to all of them, not one of whom had dreamed that\\n\\nanother human being than those of their own camp dwelt upon the\\n\\nunfriendly shores of Jungle Island.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was Gust. He came directly to the point.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Your women were stolen,” he said. “If you want ever to see them again,\\n\\ncome quickly and follow me. If we do not hurry the Cowrie will be\\n\\nstanding out to sea by the time we reach her anchorage.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Who are you?” asked Tarzan. “What do you know of the theft of my wife\\n\\nand the black woman?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I heard Kai Shang and Momulla the Maori plot with two men of your\\n\\ncamp. They had chased me from our camp, and would have killed me. Now I\\n\\nwill get even with them. Come!”\\n\\n\\n\\nGust led the four men of the Kincaid’s camp at a rapid trot through the\\n\\njungle toward the north. Would they come to the sea in time? But a few\\n\\nmore minutes would answer the question.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd when at last the little party did break through the last of the\\n\\nscreening foliage, and the harbour and the ocean lay before them, they\\n\\nrealized that fate had been most cruelly unkind, for the Cowrie was\\n\\nalready under sail and moving slowly out of the mouth of the harbour\\n\\ninto the open sea.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat were they to do? Tarzan’s broad chest rose and fell to the force\\n\\nof his pent emotions. The last blow seemed to have fallen, and if ever\\n\\nin all his life Tarzan of the Apes had had occasion to abandon hope it\\n\\nwas now that he saw the ship bearing his wife to some frightful fate\\n\\nmoving gracefully over the rippling water, so very near and yet so\\n\\nhideously far away.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn silence he stood watching the vessel. He saw it turn toward the east\\n\\nand finally disappear around a headland on its way he knew not whither.\\n\\nThen he dropped upon his haunches and buried his face in his hands.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was after dark that the five men returned to the camp on the east\\n\\nshore. The night was hot and sultry. No slightest breeze ruffled the\\n\\nfoliage of the trees or rippled the mirror-like surface of the ocean.\\n\\nOnly a gentle swell rolled softly in upon the beach.\\n\\n\\n\\nNever had Tarzan seen the great Atlantic so ominously at peace. He was\\n\\nstanding at the edge of the beach gazing out to sea in the direction of\\n\\nthe mainland, his mind filled with sorrow and hopelessness, when from\\n\\nthe jungle close behind the camp came the uncanny wail of a panther.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a familiar note in the weird cry, and almost mechanically\\n\\nTarzan turned his head and answered. A moment later the tawny figure of\\n\\nSheeta slunk out into the half-light of the beach. There was no moon,\\n\\nbut the sky was brilliant with stars. Silently the savage brute came to\\n\\nthe side of the man. It had been long since Tarzan had seen his old\\n\\nfighting companion, but the soft purr was sufficient to assure him that\\n\\nthe animal still recalled the bonds which had united them in the past.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ape-man let his fingers fall upon the beast’s coat, and as Sheeta\\n\\npressed close against his leg he caressed and fondled the wicked head\\n\\nwhile his eyes continued to search the blackness of the waters.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently he started. What was that? He strained his eyes into the\\n\\nnight. Then he turned and called aloud to the men smoking upon their\\n\\nblankets in the camp. They came running to his side; but Gust hesitated\\n\\nwhen he saw the nature of Tarzan’s companion.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Look!” cried Tarzan. “A light! A ship’s light! It must be the Cowrie.\\n\\nThey are becalmed.” And then with an exclamation of renewed hope, “We\\n\\ncan reach them! The skiff will carry us easily.”\\n\\n\\n\\nGust demurred. “They are well armed,” he warned. “We could not take the\\n\\nship—just five of us.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“There are six now,” replied Tarzan, pointing to Sheeta, “and we can\\n\\nhave more still in a half-hour. Sheeta is the equivalent of twenty men,\\n\\nand the few others I can bring will add full a hundred to our fighting\\n\\nstrength. You do not know them.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ape-man turned and raised his head toward the jungle, while there\\n\\npealed from his lips, time after time, the fearsome cry of the bull-ape\\n\\nwho would summon his fellows.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently from the jungle came an answering cry, and then another and\\n\\nanother. Gust shuddered. Among what sort of creatures had fate thrown\\n\\nhim? Were not Kai Shang and Momulla to be preferred to this great white\\n\\ngiant who stroked a panther and called to the beasts of the jungle?\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a few minutes the apes of Akut came crashing through the underbrush\\n\\nand out upon the beach, while in the meantime the five men had been\\n\\nstruggling with the unwieldy bulk of the skiff’s hull.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy dint of Herculean efforts they had managed to get it to the water’s\\n\\nedge. The oars from the two small boats of the Kincaid, which had been\\n\\nwashed away by an off-shore wind the very night that the party had\\n\\nlanded, had been in use to support the canvas of the sailcloth tents.\\n\\nThese were hastily requisitioned, and by the time Akut and his\\n\\nfollowers came down to the water all was ready for embarkation.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce again the hideous crew entered the service of their master, and\\n\\nwithout question took up their places in the skiff. The four men, for\\n\\nGust could not be prevailed upon to accompany the party, fell to the\\n\\noars, using them paddle-wise, while some of the apes followed their\\n\\nexample, and presently the ungainly skiff was moving quietly out to sea\\n\\nin the direction of the light which rose and fell gently with the\\n\\nswell.\\n\\n\\n\\nA sleepy sailor kept a poor vigil upon the Cowrie’s deck, while in the\\n\\ncabin below Schneider paced up and down arguing with Jane Clayton. The\\n\\nwoman had found a revolver in a table drawer in the room in which she\\n\\nhad been locked, and now she kept the mate of the Kincaid at bay with\\n\\nthe weapon.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Mosula woman kneeled behind her, while Schneider paced up and down\\n\\nbefore the door, threatening and pleading and promising, but all to no\\n\\navail. Presently from the deck above came a shout of warning and a\\n\\nshot. For an instant Jane Clayton relaxed her vigilance, and turned her\\n\\neyes toward the cabin skylight. Simultaneously Schneider was upon her.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first intimation the watch had that there was another craft within\\n\\na thousand miles of the Cowrie came when he saw the head and shoulders\\n\\nof a man poked over the ship’s side. Instantly the fellow sprang to his\\n\\nfeet with a cry and levelled his revolver at the intruder. It was his\\n\\ncry and the subsequent report of the revolver which threw Jane Clayton\\n\\noff her guard.\\n\\n\\n\\nUpon deck the quiet of fancied security soon gave place to the wildest\\n\\npandemonium. The crew of the Cowrie rushed above armed with revolvers,\\n\\ncutlasses, and the long knives that many of them habitually wore; but\\n\\nthe alarm had come too late. Already the beasts of Tarzan were upon the\\n\\nship’s deck, with Tarzan and the two men of the Kincaid’s crew.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the face of the frightful beasts the courage of the mutineers\\n\\nwavered and broke. Those with revolvers fired a few scattering shots\\n\\nand then raced for some place of supposed safety. Into the shrouds went\\n\\nsome; but the apes of Akut were more at home there than they.\\n\\n\\n\\nScreaming with terror the Maoris were dragged from their lofty perches.\\n\\nThe beasts, uncontrolled by Tarzan who had gone in search of Jane,\\n\\nloosed the full fury of their savage natures upon the unhappy wretches\\n\\nwho fell into their clutches.\\n\\n\\n\\nSheeta, in the meanwhile, had felt his great fangs sink into but a\\n\\nsingle jugular. For a moment he mauled the corpse, and then he spied\\n\\nKai Shang darting down the companionway toward his cabin.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a shrill scream Sheeta was after him—a scream which awoke an\\n\\nalmost equally uncanny cry in the throat of the terror-stricken\\n\\nChinaman.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Kai Shang reached his cabin a fraction of a second ahead of the\\n\\npanther, and leaping within slammed the door—just too late. Sheeta’s\\n\\ngreat body hurtled against it before the catch engaged, and a moment\\n\\nlater Kai Shang was gibbering and shrieking in the back of an upper\\n\\nberth.\\n\\n\\n\\nLightly Sheeta sprang after his victim, and presently the wicked days\\n\\nof Kai Shang of Fachan were ended, and Sheeta was gorging himself upon\\n\\ntough and stringy flesh.\\n\\n\\n\\nA moment scarcely had elapsed after Schneider leaped upon Jane Clayton\\n\\nand wrenched the revolver from her hand, when the door of the cabin\\n\\nopened and a tall and half-naked white man stood framed within the\\n\\nportal.\\n\\n\\n\\nSilently he leaped across the cabin. Schneider felt sinewy fingers at\\n\\nhis throat. He turned his head to see who had attacked him, and his\\n\\neyes went wide when he saw the face of the ape-man close above his own.\\n\\n\\n\\nGrimly the fingers tightened upon the mate’s throat. He tried to\\n\\nscream, to plead, but no sound came forth. His eyes protruded as he\\n\\nstruggled for freedom, for breath, for life.\\n\\n\\n\\nJane Clayton seized her husband’s hands and tried to drag them from the\\n\\nthroat of the dying man; but Tarzan only shook his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not again,” he said quietly. “Before have I permitted scoundrels to\\n\\nlive, only to suffer and to have you suffer for my mercy. This time we\\n\\nshall make sure of one scoundrel—sure that he will never again harm us\\n\\nor another,” and with a sudden wrench he twisted the neck of the\\n\\nperfidious mate until there was a sharp crack, and the man’s body lay\\n\\nlimp and motionless in the ape-man’s grasp. With a gesture of disgust\\n\\nTarzan tossed the corpse aside. Then he returned to the deck, followed\\n\\nby Jane and the Mosula woman.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe battle there was over. Schmidt and Momulla and two others alone\\n\\nremained alive of all the company of the Cowrie, for they had found\\n\\nsanctuary in the forecastle. The others had died, horribly, and as they\\n\\ndeserved, beneath the fangs and talons of the beasts of Tarzan, and in\\n\\nthe morning the sun rose on a grisly sight upon the deck of the unhappy\\n\\nCowrie; but this time the blood which stained her white planking was\\n\\nthe blood of the guilty and not of the innocent.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan brought forth the men who had hidden in the forecastle, and\\n\\nwithout promises of immunity from punishment forced them to help work\\n\\nthe vessel—the only alternative was immediate death.\\n\\n\\n\\nA stiff breeze had risen with the sun, and with canvas spread the\\n\\nCowrie set in toward Jungle Island, where a few hours later, Tarzan\\n\\npicked up Gust and bid farewell to Sheeta and the apes of Akut, for\\n\\nhere he set the beasts ashore to pursue the wild and natural life they\\n\\nloved so well; nor did they lose a moment’s time in disappearing into\\n\\nthe cool depths of their beloved jungle.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat they knew that Tarzan was to leave them may be doubted—except\\n\\npossibly in the case of the more intelligent Akut, who alone of all the\\n\\nothers remained upon the beach as the small boat drew away toward the\\n\\nschooner, carrying his savage lord and master from him.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd as long as their eyes could span the distance, Jane and Tarzan,\\n\\nstanding upon the deck, saw the lonely figure of the shaggy anthropoid\\n\\nmotionless upon the surf-beaten sands of Jungle Island.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was three days later that the Cowrie fell in with H.M. sloop-of-war\\n\\nShorewater, through whose wireless Lord Greystoke soon got in\\n\\ncommunication with London. Thus he learned that which filled his and\\n\\nhis wife’s heart with joy and thanksgiving—little Jack was safe at Lord\\n\\nGreystoke’s town house.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was not until they reached London that they learned the details of\\n\\nthe remarkable chain of circumstances that had preserved the infant\\n\\nunharmed.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt developed that Rokoff, fearing to take the child aboard the Kincaid\\n\\nby day, had hidden it in a low den where nameless infants were\\n\\nharboured, intending to carry it to the steamer after dark.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis confederate and chief lieutenant, Paulvitch, true to the long years\\n\\nof teaching of his wily master, had at last succumbed to the treachery\\n\\nand greed that had always marked his superior, and, lured by the\\n\\nthoughts of the immense ransom that he might win by returning the child\\n\\nunharmed, had divulged the secret of its parentage to the woman who\\n\\nmaintained the foundling asylum. Through her he had arranged for the\\n\\nsubstitution of another infant, knowing full well that never until it\\n\\nwas too late would Rokoff suspect the trick that had been played upon\\n\\nhim.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe woman had promised to keep the child until Paulvitch returned to\\n\\nEngland; but she, in turn, had been tempted to betray her trust by the\\n\\nlure of gold, and so had opened negotiations with Lord Greystoke’s\\n\\nsolicitors for the return of the child.\\n\\n\\n\\nEsmeralda, the old Negro nurse whose absence on a vacation in America\\n\\nat the time of the abduction of little Jack had been attributed by her\\n\\nas the cause of the calamity, had returned and positively identified\\n\\nthe infant.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ransom had been paid, and within ten days of the date of his\\n\\nkidnapping the future Lord Greystoke, none the worse for his\\n\\nexperience, had been returned to his father’s home.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so that last and greatest of Nikolas Rokoff’s many rascalities had\\n\\nnot only miserably miscarried through the treachery he had taught his\\n\\nonly friend, but it had resulted in the arch-villain’s death, and given\\n\\nto Lord and Lady Greystoke a peace of mind that neither could ever have\\n\\nfelt so long as the vital spark remained in the body of the Russian and\\n\\nhis malign mind was free to formulate new atrocities against them.\\n\\n\\n\\nRokoff was dead, and while the fate of Paulvitch was unknown, they had\\n\\nevery reason to believe that he had succumbed to the dangers of the\\n\\njungle where last they had seen him—the malicious tool of his master.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd thus, in so far as they might know, they were to be freed for ever\\n\\nfrom the menace of these two men—the only enemies which Tarzan of the\\n\\nApes ever had had occasion to fear, because they struck at him cowardly\\n\\nblows, through those he loved.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a happy family party that were reunited in Greystoke House the\\n\\nday that Lord Greystoke and his lady landed upon English soil from the\\n\\ndeck of the Shorewater.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccompanying them were Mugambi and the Mosula woman whom he had found\\n\\nin the bottom of the canoe that night upon the bank of the little\\n\\ntributary of the Ugambi.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe woman had preferred to cling to her new lord and master rather than\\n\\nreturn to the marriage she had tried to escape.\\n\\n\\n\\nTarzan had proposed to them that they might find a home upon his vast\\n\\nAfrican estates in the land of the Waziri, where they were to be sent\\n\\nas soon as opportunity presented itself.\\n\\n\\n\\nPossibly we shall see them all there amid the savage romance of the\\n\\ngrim jungle and the great plains where Tarzan of the Apes loves best to\\n\\nbe.\\n\\n\\n\\nWho knows?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BEASTS OF TARZAN ']\n"
